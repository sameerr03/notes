# Government Debt

The debt is covered by the government issuing bonds. 

The goverment debt is the sum of all the bonds sold over time - matured bonds. 

A soverign debt crisis occurs when governement bonds become considered risky. 

Debt relative to [[Gross Domestic Product]] is the debt ratio. An increasing debt ratio is unsustainable (achieved by borrowing further to cover loans)

## Debt ratio
the debt ratio can fall if
- primary budget balance(T-G) is positive
- GDP is growing faster than governement debt
- inflation is high (real value of debt falls)
