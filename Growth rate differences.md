According to the [[Kaldor facts]], poor countries grow faster. This is supported by the [[Solow model]] as the further away a country is from their steady state, the faster their growth rate. $$\frac{\dot k}k=s\frac{y}k-(\delta+n)$$$$=s(\frac{Ah}k)^{1-\alpha}-(\delta+n)$$if $$\frac{k}{Ah}<(\frac{s}{\delta+g+n})^{1/(1-\alpha)}$$then $\frac{\dot{k}}k>g$ as at the steady state the growth rate of the countries is at $g$. Therefore if $\tilde k$ is low compared to the steady state value of $\tilde k^*$ the country will grow faster than g, quicker than rich countries who are at their steady states. However,  However, some countries grow slowly despite being poor. This is explained by the fact that poor countries have low stready states. This is called conditional convergence. This implies that the world is not necessarily getting more equal.
