The ISLM curve is the :: combination of the IS curve and the LM curve. The point of equillibrium is the point where the goods and services and the Money market are in equillibrium.

## [[Fiscal Policy]] on ISLM

The IS curve suggests fiscal policy changes to $Y_3*$ wheras according to the ISLM model it changes just to $Y_2*$. 

For fiscal policy, the government changes exogenous variables like government spending and taxes, which change through the [[Keynesian multiplier]]. With an increase in $\bar{G}$, the actual expenditure in the [[Keynesian cross]] shifts upward, increasing Y according to the multiplier.

However with the LM included, increase in income results in an increase in liquid money demand, pushing up the money demand curve up.

This results in an increase in r, reducing [[investment]], thereby reducing Y.

Therefore,$$\Delta Y=\Delta G\cdot \frac{1}{1-MPC}-\Delta I$$

As a result the equillibrium is at $Y_2*$, lower than $Y_3*$

Fiscal policy has the knock on effect of decreasing investment. An increase in G is similar to a decrease in T but works through the tax multiplier. Flatter LM curves result in a larger equillibrium Y as the Liquid money does not increase as much, keeping investment relatively higher.  

## [[Monetary policy]] and ISLM

Expansionary policy increases liquid money supply, leading to a decrease in r, wich increases investment, shifting the LM curve outward

If the IS curve is flatter, the denominator of its slope, the slope of the investment function is higher, which implies at a lower interest level, investment will be far greater than before, leading to new equillibrium Y being higher. 

## Combined policy
With fiscal policy, money demand increases due to increasing in Y, causing the **crowding out effect** of a higher rate of interest, resulting in lower increase in Y than the increase according to the multiplier due to lower investment.
The same interest rate can be maintained by increasing the Liquid money supply through monetary policy. This results in no decrease in investment, increase in Y is according to the multiplier.

The Desired Y can be achieved by combining fiscal and monetary policy.
