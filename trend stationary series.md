A stochastic process is trend stationary if an underlying trend in the process can be removed, leaving behind a [[Stationarity|stationary]] process. Consider the [[Time Series]] equation $$y_t=a+b\cdot t+e_t$$where $t$ is the time trend, $e_t$ is the error term which is assumed to be a [[white noise processes|white noise process]].
Using [[Simple Linear Regression|OLS]], the parameters $a, b$ can be estimated as $\hat a, \hat b$. If the estimated $\hat b$ is [[Inference|significantly]] different from zero, this is sufficient to show with a high degree of confidence that the variable $y_t$ is non stationary. 

The residuals of the series is given by $$\hat e_t=y_t-\hat a-\hat b\cdot t$$If this series of estimated residuals is statistically shown to be stationary, then the residuals are referred to as the **detrended data** and the original series $y_t$ is **trend-stationary**. However, if the process requires [[Difference equations|differencing]] then the process is called difference stationary and possesses one or more unit root. Consider the series $$\Delta y_t=b+e_t$$from the original series, the residuals are non-stationary. The ACF will slowly decay over time.
