## Stabilizing the economy
### Automatic stabilizers
**automatic stabilizers** automatically offset and expansion or contraction of the economy
1. Increase in tax rate (lowers multiplier)
2. Unemployment insurance - helps households smooth consumption

### non-automatic stabilizers
Government can counteract the fall in aggregate demand via **fiscal stimulus**
- Reduction in taxes to encourage private sector spending
- Increase in government spending which directly increases AD (works through the multiplier, the increase in Y will be greater than increase in G)

Budget balance $=T-G$
Fiscal stimulus will result in negative budget balance, which will increase [[govt. debt]] in case it is not reversed after the recession. Austerity policies that cut spending can increase the net budget balance, and may reduce debt. However, they further reduce AD, which can reinforce a recession.
