The goal of a financial manager is to increase the value of the firm (The value of the firm is described by the present value of future [[Cash flows]] - [[DCF valuation]]). This is done in order to maximize shareholder/stakeholder value. This is achieved by:
- Selecting value generating ventures in order to create and maximize profits - purchase of real assets used in producing goods and services
- Making smart financial decisions - how to sell claims of the firms' cash flows in order to raise money

#### Principal agent problems
Financial managers are subject to the principal agent problem, where a conflict of interest emerges between the principal and the agent - or the shareholders and the manager. Managers may only care about their salary, whereas shareholders want the business to generate value. 

These conflicts can be avoided by aligning the incentives of the managers with the incentives of the shareholders - performance bonuses, stock options
