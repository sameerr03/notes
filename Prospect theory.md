Prospect theory is an alternative of the [[vNm Expected utility]] theory, that is more focused on imperical data. 

Expected utility contains two major components, the utiltity function and the uncertainty that comes with the payoffs or the utilities - represented by probability of certain events happening. In prospect theory, the Utility function is replaced by the impirical value function, obtained based on experiments.

the value function overemphasises the value lost or given due to small gains and losses (shown by the slope of the graph) compared to a normal utility function - behaviour by real humans rather than an arbitrary mathematical function. The origin of the graph now is relative to where the DM is at the moment. A current value of 0 has loss and gains on either side just as a current value of 10000. The slopes reflect loss aversion making the DM irrational. 

Similarly, impirical data shows that probabilities are interpreted subjectively by the decision maker. This means that a probability of 0.5 or 1 objectively is either over or underestimated by the decisionmaker leading to a different weight on the value function values as opposed to the objective probability that is used in the expected utility theory.
