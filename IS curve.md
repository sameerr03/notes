Investments Savings curve::All combinations of r and Y that produce an equilibrium in the [[Keynesian cross|goods and services market]] is the IS curve

Equation:$$Y*=\frac{C_0+f+\bar{G}}{1-C_1}- \frac{kr*}{1-C_1}$$
The constants are the autonomous parts of the a iS curve that do not respond to the rate of interest.

**slope:** $$\frac{1-MPC}{\delta I/\delta r}$$ Slope < 0


## Derivations
### of IS curve
We know that the Planned expenditure is
$$PE=C_0+C_1Y+\bar{I}+\bar{G}$$

Let the rate of interest increase from r1 to r2
Then, $$PE_1=C_0+C_1Y+(f-kr_1)+\bar{G}$$$$PE_2=C_0+C_1Y+(f-kr_2)+\bar{G}$$
As r2>r1, PE1>PE2 ([[investment]] reduces)

The IS curve is obtained from Plotting all r values with the [[Intro to Eco (S2022)/equillibrium]] Y value at that r
