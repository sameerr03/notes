| Treatment | a        |
| Control   | c        |

Risk of event in the treatment group $R_1 = \frac{a}{a+b}$
Risk of event in the control group $R_2 = \frac{c}{c+d}$
relative risk reduction $=\frac{R_1}{R_2}$
Absolute risk increase/reduction $= |R_1-R_2|$
Odds of event in the treatment group $=\frac{a}{b}$
Odds of event in the control group $=\frac{c}{d}$
