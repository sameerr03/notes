An extension of the [[Model of loans]], where people meet each other through banks for lending and borrowing purposes. Suppose an individual lives for two periods where their endowment is as such 

- **L-type** receive a non-zero endowment in $t=1$ and nothing in $t=2$
- **B-Type** receive a non-zero endowment in $t=2$ and nothing in $t=1$

We assume that these two agents cannot meet each other, except through banks. 

###### L-type
When young:
$$c_{1L}\le y-l$$When old:
$$c_{2L}\le r_Ll$$Where:
- $l$ is the amount that is loaned out by the L-type agents (bank deposits)
- $r_L$ is the gross interest rate of bank deposits 

The lifetime budget set is $$c_{1L}+\frac{1}{r_L}c_{2L}=y$$

As $r_L$ increases, $c_{1L}^*$ falls (only substitution effect) -> the constraint gets steeper and therefore the optimal loan supply increases

##### B-Type
When young,$$c_{1B}=b$$When old,$$c_{2B}=y-r_Bb$$Where:
- $b$ is the amount that is borrowed by the B-type agents
- $r_B$ is the gross interest rate of taking a loan from the bank 

The lifetime budget set is given by $$r_Bc_{1B}+c_{2B}=y$$

As $r_B$ increases, the slope of the constraint falls -> $c_{1B}^*$ falls and thus $b$ falls (loan demand).

##### Role of the bank
Putting together both the loan supply and demand relationships with interest rates,

Where:
- $r_B^0$ and $r_L^0$ are the gross interest rates offered by the bank for borrowing and lending
- The shaded area gives us the banks profit (difference between interest rates between borrowing and lending for a particular number of loans)

In order to maximize profits, the banks has to choose $L^*$ at the appropriate level$$\max_L(r_B-r_L)\times L$$
