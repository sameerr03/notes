The aggregate demand curve is a visual representation of the different combinations of output($Y$) and prices ($P$) where the goods and money market are both in equilibrium simultaneously.

## Derivation
With an increase in prices, the [[Money market#Supply side|Money supply]] ($M/P$) reduces resulting in an increase in interest rates, leading to a fall in production in te [[Keynesian cross]].

This is represented in the [[ISLM model]] by a shift in the LM curve

Mapping all such alterations in prices with the equillibrium Y from the ISLM gives the AD curve

## [[Fiscal Policy|Fiscal]] and Monetary [[Monetary policy]]

For expansionary fiscal policy, the [[IS curve]] shifts outward. Therefore at the same prices, the equillibrium Y increases. This is represented by an outward shift of the AD curve. Similarly, for the same price, Y increases due to monetary policy by an increase in money supply monetary policy shifts outward AD curve.

Any expansionary policy results in :: an outward expansion of the AD curve. Contractionary policy results in :: the inward movement of the AD curve.
