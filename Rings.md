A ring $R$ is a set with two binary operations, denoted as $(R,+,.)$. A ring satisfies the following axioms. 
1. Closure of addition and multiplication: $\forall\  x,y\in R, x+y\in R, x.y\in R$
2. Addition is commutative: $(x+y=y+x), \forall x,y\in R$
3. Addition is associate: $(x+y)+z=x+(y+z),\forall\ x,y\in R$
4. Existence of additive identity: $\exists\ 0\in R$ such that $x+0=0+x=x,\ \forall\ x\in R$
5. Existence of additive inverse: $\forall x\in R,\ \exists\ y\in R$ such that $x+y=y+x=0\ (y=-x)$
6. Multiplication is associative: $(xy)z=x(yz),\ \forall\ x,y,z\in R$
7. Distributive property: $x(y+z)=xy+xz,\ \forall x, y, z\in R$

If $1\in R$ such that $x\cdot 1=1\cdot x=x\ \forall\ R$, $R$ is a **unital** ring

If $\forall x, y\in R$, $x\cdot y=y\cdot x$, $R$ is a commutative ring

Matrices are unital rings but not commutative
$\mathbb Z$ are unital and commutative rings
