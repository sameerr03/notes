In order to exercise proper financial planning, forecasting needs to be used on company financials in order for the [[Financial management]] to determine the appropriate financial policies and funding requirements in the future. 

This is done through the creation of **pro-forma** statements of the [[Income statement]] and the [[Balance sheet]] - these are projected versions of the balance sheet. These pro-forma statements require:
- Sales forecasts - as many cash flows directly depend on the level of sales. Done using demand projections
- Asset Requirements - Additional assets required by the company in order to meet the projected level of sales. 
- Financial requirements - Amount of financing required to pay for the additional assets required to meet the forecasts
- Plug Variable - Adaptive variable that makes the assets and liabilities of the balance sheet balance. It is determined by management decisions, through the type of financing that is going to be used
- Economic assumptions - Assumptions about the upcoming economic environment - factors such as the interest rate, [[Gross Domestic Product]] growth rate and so on

**Forecasting the income statement**
All items in the income statement are taken as a percentage of revenue or sales. Using the sales projections, and keeping all the line item percentages constant, all the projected line items can be found. An exception to this is [[Corporate income tax]] as there will be a predetermined rate applied. Some important measures in order to determine the pro-forma balance sheet are taken from the dividend amount and retained earnings amount as that is how the net income is distributed and will affect the shareholder's equity portion of the balance sheet. 

$$\text{Dividend Payout Ratio }(d)=\frac{\text{Dividend Paid}}{\text{Net Income}}$$$$\text{Retained Earnings/plowback Ratio }(b)=1-d$$

**Forecasting the balance sheet**
On the assets side of the balance sheet, line items are forecasted using the same percentage of sales method along with the sales growth forecasts. This gives the financial management an idea of the total asset requirements for sustaining the projected sales growth. 

However, liabilities do not necessarily have any relation to current year sales. Liabilities like accounts payable will be connected to sales and are called **spontaneous liabilities**. Other liabilities such as long term debt will not be related to the sales of each year. Therefore this portion of the balance sheet is taken as the plug variable. Assuming constant dividend payout ratio allows shareholder's equity to be forecasted (Also depends on the financing method employed by the firm).

In order to find the EFn or the external financing needed by the firm in order to meet the asset requirement, the following formula is used:
$$\text{EFN}=(\frac{\text{Total Assets}}{\text{Sales}})\times\Delta\text{Sales}-(\frac{\text{SL}}{\text{Sales}})\times\Delta\text{Sales}-(\text{Profit Margin}\times\text{Projected Sales})(1-d)$$Where:
- $(\frac{\text{Total Assets}}{\text{Sales}})\times\Delta\text{Sales}$ is the increase in liabilities in order to meet the asset requirements
- $\text{SL}$ are spontaneous liabilities that are projected using sales
- $(\frac{\text{SL}}{\text{Sales}})\times\Delta\text{Sales}$ are the liabilities that do not require external financing (not a part of the plug variable)
- $(\text{Profit Margin}\times\text{Projected Sales})(1-d)$ is the projected retained earnings of the firm, that can be used to increase assets instead of having to increase the liabilities. ([[Ratio analysis#Profitability ratios|profit margin]])

#### Growth Rates
![[Pasted image 20240205160437.png|600]]
Typically at low growth levels, internal financing can be used, as the projected addition to retained earnings is much greater than the EFN. However at higher growth levels, EFN can be necessary as there is a deficit. If a company restricts itself to only internal financing, its growth rate will have to be lower. This can be found using the **Internal Growth Rate** metric, defined as the maximum growth rate a firm can achieve with no external financing. $$\text{Internal Growth Rate}=\frac{\text{ROA}\times b}{1-(\text{ROA}\times b)}$$It can also be written as $$\text{IGR}=b\times\text{ROE}\times\frac{\text{Equity}}{\text{Net Assets}}$$
Where:
- ROA is the [[Ratio analysis#Profitability ratios|return on assets]]. 
- $b$ is the retained earnings ratio

However, the firm can achieve higher growth rates by using external financing. This growth rate can be found using the **Sustainable Growth Rate** metric, defined as the maximum growth rate a firm can attain in the long run with no external equity financing while it maintains a constant [[Ratio analysis#Leverage ratios|Debt-equity ratio]].$$\text{Sustainable  Growth Rate}=\frac{\text{ROE}\times b}{1-(\text{ROE}\times b)}$$Where:
- ROE is the [[Ratio analysis#Profitability ratios|return on equity]]

The ROE is also given by the [[Ratio analysis#DuPont Identity]]. Therefore an increase in any of the terms in the identity will increase the ROE, increasing the SGR. An increase in the dividend payout ratio will decrease the SGR. An increase in debt equity ratio will increase the ROE increasing the SGR.
