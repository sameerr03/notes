These kinds of games have two types of information incompleteness
- Unobservable type (Assymetric information) - Players have private information, information is only known by them. Eg: Employer does not know employee's ability. 
- Unobservable action - Actions of the players are not known, only the final outcome of the game. Employer does not know how much effort employee uses, but sees final outocome. 

The private information or 'type' is determined by a dummy player. The dummy player has no role to play afterwards.
