**Population** is a collection of items with mesurable values associated with them

**The population of interest** is the target population of a particular variable. [[sample]] groups can be used to infer information about the entire population of interest.

We assume that there is a probability distribution such that the measurable values of the items in the popultation are independant random variables having this distribution.

### Statistic
A random variable whose value is determined by sample data
Two important statistics are 
- Sample mean:$$\bar{X}=\frac{\sum_{i=n}^nX_i}{n}$$
- Sample variance: $$S^2=\frac{\sum_{i=n}^n(X_i-\bar{X})}{n-1}$$

If there is a population with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, and our sample $(X_1,X_2....,X_n)$ is random, then
$$E(\bar{X})=\mu\ \ \ \ \ \ var(\bar{X})=\frac{\sigma^2}{n}$$
As the sample size increases, the spread of $\bar{X}$ becomes smaller but the mean remains constant.
