Poorer countries produce much less output per worker than their richer counterparts, after accounting for quality and quantity differences in the factors of production. This implies that the underlying cause for this difference is due to lower productivity. The possible reasons for this are due to the slow diffusion of technology from the countries at the technological frontier to the countries withing the frontier, shown by frictions in [[Technology Transfer]]. Another possible reason is due to the fact that poorer countries do not allocate resources optimally, or the **misallocation** of resources. 

Given a standard production function for a firm,$$Y=Af(K,H)$$misallocation is reflected in the $A$ term (Total factor productivity term). Variations in $A$ reflect the changes in productivity caused by the misallocation across firms. 

#### Sources of misallocation
- Statutory - Provisions identified by law (differing tax or tariffs based on firms size or sales stated by law)  
- Discretory - Made by government, that benefit or penalize specific firms, such as subsidies, tax breaks, etc.  
- Market imperfections - Monopolies, Market frictions
- Non-meritocratic employment: Discrimination in hiring

#### Measuring misallocation
- Measure sources and then assess the effects of the misallocation by the sources on the firm or the industry via a model  
- Identifying the extent of misallocation without identifying the underlying source of misallocation. This is done by comparing marginal products of firms, higher means more misallocation.

Given information on $y$, $k$, $h$ and $f$, we can find $A$.
