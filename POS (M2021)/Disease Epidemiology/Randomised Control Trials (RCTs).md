# RCTs
RCTs are a type of scientific experiment that reduces sources of bias when testing the effectiveness of new policies. The process of these trials are:
- Population groups are randomly allocated to two or more groups. Randomization allows us to observe similar individuals under similar scenarios but with one difference (subject of the RCT, policy or vaccine)
- Policies are offeed to a selcted group
- As the people are similarly selected, a confounding factor will affect the different groups in identical manners, negating their effects. (see: [[Confounders and Covariates]])
- This isolates the effect of the policy or lack of policy in each group, establishing causality.

- In order to replicate the results in other locations, it is necessary to understand which group did better and why

## Flaws of RCTs
- The offer is random but compliance is not
- There might be contamination of the control group which try to imitate the experimental group

## Elimination of [[Biases]]
- The trial is blinded: Information which may influence the participants is withheld until after the experiment is complete. Blinding can be imposed on subjects, researchers, technicians and so on. Good blinding reduces bias
- The randomness in assignment of subjects reduces selection and allocation bias
