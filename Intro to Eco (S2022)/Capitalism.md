# Capitalism
Capitalism is an Economic system (A way of organising the economy that is distinctive in its basic institutions) governed by its [[institutions]].

## Institutions of capitalism
- [[Private Property]]
- [[markets|Markets]]
- [[firm|Economic Firms]]

Production takes place in firms. The markets and private property are essential to the functioning of firms as the inputs and outputs are private property, and the outputs are sold in markets for profit

Capitalism can be less effective if any of these institutions are compromised - insecurity of private property, lack of competitiveness in markets, firms surviving due to connections and not being forced to compete

In democtatic capitalism, [[institutions]] exist in order to protect people against coercion and to ensure that the majority of economic interactions are conducted voluntarily.

## Impacts on living standards
Capitalism lead to increased living standards because
- Impact on [[Technology]]: firms that competed with each other in markets had strong initiatives to adopt and develop newer technologies
- [[Specialization]]: the growth of firms and the expansion of markets linking the world allowed for unprecedented speciallization in tasks and production

The effects of capitalism on [[Gross Domestic Product]] per capita growth is not straightforward due to differing political and institutional conditions across countries.
