#### Preconception of value
[[Biases#Confirmation bias]] about companies. More you know, stronger preconception about the company. This results in bias during valuations. This bias is deterministic on the final valuation. An investment banker looking to complete a deal is going to value a company as a bargain to the potential buyer, because they are biased to do so. 

#### Valuation is a "science"
Despite the numbers, there is no degree of certainty in them, as they are estimates about the future. Growth companies have very uncertain futures, leading to more uncertain numbers. Despite the uncertainty however, it is arguably more important to value a growth company with future potential (harder) than to evaluate a business that is very fixed and has more certainty.

#### Bigger is better
Assumptions build models. More inputs or bigger models result in more assumptions. Be parsimonious in valuation. Less is more.
