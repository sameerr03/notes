Debt, Equity - Ways to fund the business

When valuing a business, there are two approaches - value equity in the business or the whole business

###### Equity value
Equity valuations only look at the cash flows that the equity investors get. As a result the rate of discount is rate of return that equity investors need to make given the risk of the equity (cost of equity). [[DCF valuation]] is done using this method by using cash flows to equity investors discounted to cost of equity. Dividend discount model is one such [[DCF valuation]] method. 

###### Business Value
Look at overall cash flows from the business. This is discounted to the weighted average of the cost of the equity and the cost of debt. This is called the **Weighted average cost of capital**. 

2 ways to value equity - directly through equity value, indirectly using second approach and subtract debt. These should theoretically be equal. **INTERNAL CONSISTENCY** about cash flows and discounts rate.
