The spot interest rate $s_k$ is the interest rate for time $k$ periods (annualized). Since interest can change at any given time, this results in the [[Fixed Income Securities#Bond Valuation|present value]] calculation of the bond being quite different in real life. For a two period bond, the present value is given by $$PV = \frac{c}{1+s_1}+\frac{c+F}{(1+s_2)^2}$$The changing interest rates at each time period is the reason for bond yields being different at different maturities (term structure).

#### Forward rates
The forward interest rate is a predetermined interest rate set this period for the next period. $f_{ij}$ is the interest rate for time period $j$, which was agreed upon by two parties in the previous time period $i$. Based on spot rates, if I deposit one dollar in the bank, my return after 2 years will be $$R=(1+s_2)^2$$If the parties instead agree to use spot rates for the first time period and a forward rate for the second period, the return is given by $$R=(1+s_1)(1+f_{12})$$If the two returns do not match, this presents a possibility for infinite risk free arbitrage. Therefore, under the no arbitrage condition, $$(1+s_2)^2=(1+s_1)(1+f_{12})$$This is the forward rate equation for 2 periods.
