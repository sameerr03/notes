# Employment rent
The [[economic rent]] a worker receives when the net value of her job exceeds the net value of her next best alternative (that is, being unemployed).

The benefits of loosing your job:
- Free time (disutility of their job and time spent commuting)

The disadvantages:
- Income
- Loss of firm specific assets
- Social stigma
- Insurance and other benefits offered by the employer are lost


## Calculating employment rent
![[Pasted image 20220327185908.png]]
- $E_h$ is the employment rent per hour
- $B_j$ is the net benefit of the job per hour
- $B_u$ is the net benefit of unemployment per hour

$E_h=B_j-B_u$
$=10-6$
$=4$
Employment rent is 4 per hour
Total employment rent $E$ is:
$E=E_h\times h$
$=4 \times (35\times44)$
$=6160$

USD 6160 is the total economic rent of her employment

## Reservation Wage
The wage of the next best option. In case of unemployment benefit, the wage may be 6. This means that if a firm pays the employee a wage of 6 dollars, they are indifferent in their employment status, and therefor will put in no effort.

## Unemployment
Without unemployment, economic rents would not exist. This means that little effort would be exerted in a job by a worker as they could loose their job and immediately find another with the same wage.
