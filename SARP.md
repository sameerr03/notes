SARP of Strong axiom of [[revealed preferences]] is an addition to [[WARP]]. 

A choice set satisfies SARP if there does not exist a j and k such that $\tilde{x}^J$RP$\tilde{x}^K$ directly or indirectly AND $\tilde{x}^K$RD$\tilde{x}^J$ directly or indirectly.
There are no cycles in the cost matrix. These conditions being satisfied implies a [[Utility function]] existing.
