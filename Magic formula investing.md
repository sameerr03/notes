Magic formula investing uses rules in order to generate a formulaic approach to [[Value investing]]. Joel Greenblatt developed the magic formula based on the EBIT - Earning before interest and taxes, yield - Earnings per share divided by the current stock price, ROIC - Return on invested capital which measures how efficiently a company generates returns on their invested capital and assets. Magic formula takes in only large cap companies and excludes insurance and finance companies. The magic formula is given by:
1. Calculate the companies' earnings yeild (EBIT/Enterprise Value)
2. Calculate each companies' return on capital (EBIT/(Net fixed Assets + Working Capital))
3. Rank selected companies by highest earnings yeild and highest return on capital
4. Buy two or three positions each month in the top 20-30 companies over the course of a year
5. Each year rebalance the portfolio
