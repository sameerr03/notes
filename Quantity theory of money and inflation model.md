The quantity theory of money states that $$MV=PY$$Where:
- $M$ is the amount of nominal money
- $V$ is the velocity of money or the amount of times money changes hands
- $P$ is the price level of the economy
- $Y$ is the nominal [[Gross Domestic Product]] of the country

Assuming GDP is constant, and taking logs on both sides of the equation,
$$\log M+\log V=\log P+\log Y$$Taking derivatives,
$$\frac{dM}M+\frac{dV}V=\frac{dP}P+\frac{dY}Y$$In this equation,
- $dM/M$ is the growth in money supply
- $dV/V$ is the growth rate of the velocity of money = 0 (empirically)
- $dP/P$ is the growth rate of the price level in the economy ([[inflation]] rate)
- $dY/Y$ is the GDP growth rate

Based on our constant GDP assumption,
$$g_M=g_I$$

From the main equation, we get the following result as well with our assumption $$P\propto M$$
**From the [[Inflation model]],**
at the SME, we know that$$v_t=\frac{N_t(y-c_1)}{M_t}$$This means that $$P_t=\frac{M_t}{N_t(y-c_1)}$$The GDP= amount of goods produced =$N_ty$. For the GDP to remain constant, there has to be no change in $N_t$ or $n=1$. This means that $$N_t=N_{t+1}=\text{.....}=N$$Therefore,$$P_t=\frac{M_t}{N(y-c_1)}$$$$P_t\propto  M_t$$ The inflation model and the quantity theory of money give us the same result
