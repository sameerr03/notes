# Real Wage
The real wage is the nominal wage divided by the price level of the bundle of consumer goods purchased
$$w=\frac{W}{P}$$

Each firm decides on its price, wage and number of people to hire. Adding up all of these across all firms gives us the total employment in the economy and the real wage
