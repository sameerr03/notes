Tax levied by the government on corporate income. The tax rate is subject to constant change and revision. Taxes are often levied based upon a slab basis. Consider the tax structure

0-50,000: 15%
50,000-75,000: 25%
75,000-100,000: 34%
100,000-335,000: 39%
335,000 above: 34%

The $\text{Tax Bill}$ is the amount of tax paid by the corporation. It is given by 
$$\text{Tax Bill}=\sum (\text{slab tax rate}\times\text{income in slab})$$Suppose a corporation has 4,000,000 of taxable income in a particular year. Its tax bill will be$$\text{Tax Bill}=0.15\times50,000+0.25\times25,000+0.34\times25,000+0.39\times235,000+0.34\times3,665,000$$$$=1,360,000$$
#### Average tax rate 
The average tax rate is given by 
$$TR_A=\frac{\text{Tax Bill}}{\text{Taxable Income}}$$
For the corporation in the example, $$TR_A=\frac{1,360,000}{4,000,000}=0.34$$Therefore the average tax rate is 34%.

#### Marginal tax rate
The percentage of tax paid on the next unit of additional taxable income earned. **Calculated using a slope function when an additional amount of taxable income is added** (1 unit if amount is not mentioned). 

If the corporation in the example is projected to make an additional 1,000,000 in taxable income, the tax bill at this new figure is given by $$\text{Tax Bill}=0.15\times50,000+0.25\times25,000+0.34\times25,000+0.39\times235,000+0.34\times4,665,000$$$$=1,700,000$$
The marginal tax rate is given by:$$TR_M=\frac{1,700,000-1,360,000}{5,000,000-4,000,000}=0.34$$Therefore the marginal tax rate is 34%.
