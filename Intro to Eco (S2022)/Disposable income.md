Disposable income :: The level of income available to households for spending and saving. It is the [[Gross Domestic Product]] - taxes + government transfers + net income from abroad = [[consumption function|consumption spending]](C) + Savings(S)

- Taxes: Money transferred to the govt
- Govt transfer:  transfers from the govt - unemployment benefits, healthcare assistance, insurance

## As a standard of living 

Better measure of standards of living than [[Gross Domestic Product]] as it shows the amount of money that can be used to buy goods and services without having to borrow money. However, the average value of this metric can hide income inequality giving the illusion of better standards of living.

## Drawbacks as a mesure of wellbeing
- Does not account for services that cannot be monetized (unpaid work within hoseholds)
- Important factors such as free time and quality of physical environment that do not have an assosiated (or free govt provided healthcare and eductation) cost are not included
- Average income does not describe income unequality
