The two types of surpluses that determine welfare in an economy are:
Consumer surplus -> The difference between marginal wilingess to pay (maximum amount that consumer is willing to pay for 1 extra unit of good) and market prices
Produces surplus -> The difference between market prices and the marginal willingness to accept (maximum amount that the product is willing to relieve in exchange for selling one more unit of their good.).

On a demand-supply curve, this  is represented as

### Deadweight loss

Losses that are not particular to one actor but the whole economy due to a deviation from the optimum. 

When taxes increase, prices increase for the consumer. As a result, we move down the demand curve and demand gets reduced. As the demand is low, there is no point for a producer to produce the earlier optimal amount. The supply also falls. Therefore with a tax policy, the total production reduces. The   change in prices is reflected by 
$$p_c-t=p_p$$

When demand and supply post taxes are the same, i.e., $$D(p_c)=S(p_p)=S(p_c-t)$$ the new equillibrium quantity of good q* is obtained. As there is a reduction in   producition from the optimum, there is an amount lost. Consumer and producer surplus both reduce. A certain amount goes to the government (txq*) which goes back into the economy (rectangular region). The amount lost due to the decrease in output (triangle) is the deadweight loss.
