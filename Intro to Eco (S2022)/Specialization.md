# Specialization
Specialization is the division of labour that increases the productivity of labour by narrowing the focus of production onto a more limited range of activities

People only specialize if they have a method of obtaining other goods that they need. In [[Capitalism]], this is achieved through markets. Necessary goods and services can be obtained from other specialists in the markets.
