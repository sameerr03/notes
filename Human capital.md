The forms of human captial are healthcare and education.
#### Healthcare
Good health makes workers more productive. People who are more productive earn more and therefore it is possible that as people get richer they value healthcare more (more demand). Causation between y->h or h->y is not clear

#### Education
With each additional year of education, wage increases -> workers can be more productive.
