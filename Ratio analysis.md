Ratio analysis helps standardize information about a companies financials statements (from [[Balance sheet]] and [[Income statement]]). It allows for either an analysis of ratio trends (shows the firms performance in certain metrics over time) or for easier comparison with other companies or companies in the same industry. 

It is important to note that there is no underlying theory behind these financial ratios. As a result there is no way to tell which ratios are relevant to a particular business model. Beyond that there is no indication for optimal levels of each ratio and thus the analysis is very subjective. Comparisons are also difficult to make between similar firms as complex and diversified firms (like most top companies) are difficult to find similar companies to. 

Ratio analysis comes in marny categories
##### Liquidity ratios
These ratios give us information about whether a company has short term solvency/liquidity. If its assets are greater than its liabilities, then the company is solvent.
$$\text{Current Ratio}=\frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}$$A current ratio>1 implies short term solvency. 
$$\text{Quick Ratio}=\frac{\text{Current Assets}-\text{Inventory}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}$$Inventories are typically the least liquid current assets and removing it from the current assets gives us a better idea about short term liquidity and inventory size. An extremely large inventory could be a problem.
$$\text{Cash Ratio}=\frac{\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}$$Cash is the most liquid current asset and thus it is useful to see this ratio for short term liquidity. However, too much cash can mean that the firm is not making optimal use of resources.

##### Leverage ratios
These ratios give us an idea about the long term solvency and the financial leverage of the firm
$$\text{Total Debt Ratio}=\frac{\text{Total Assets}-\text{Total Equity}}{\text{Total Assets}}$$Assets have to be bought with equity and debt. $TA=TE+TD$. Therefore this gives us an idea of how much debt the firm has.
$$\text{Debt Equity Ratio}=\frac{\text{Total Debt}}{\text{Total Equity}}$$
$$\text{Equity Multiplier}=\frac{\text{Total Assets}}{\text{Total Equity}}=1+\text{Debt Equity Ratio}$$Gives us an idea of how much assets the equity of the firm has bought. 

##### Coverage ratios
$$\text{Times Interest Earned}=\frac{\text{EBIT}}{\text{Interest}}$$
$$\text{Cash Coverage}=\frac{\text{EBITDA}}{\text{Interest}}$$
##### Inventory Ratios
$$\text{Inventory Turnover}=\frac{\text{COGS}}{\text{Inventory}}$$Measures how often a company replaces inventory relative to COGS.
$$\text{Day's Sales in Inventory}=\frac{\text{365}}{\text{Inventory Turnover}}$$Measures the number of days it takes for the inventory to get replaced. (365 because financial statements are for a year).

##### Receivables Ratios
$$\text{Receivables Turnover}=\frac{\text{Sales}}{\text{Accounts Receivable}}$$Gives how often a company converts all of the credit it gives out into sales in a year(receives cash for sales).$$\text{Day's Sales in Receivables}=\frac{\text{365}}{\text{Receivables Turnover}}$$Gives the number of days taken for a company to receive its given credit.
$$\text{Total Asset Turnover (TAT)}=\frac{\text{Sales}}{\text{Total Assets}}$$Measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to get sales. Typically this ratio is less than 1. 

##### Profitability ratios
$$\text{Profit Margin}=\frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Sales}}$$
$$\text{EBITDA Margin}=\frac{\text{EBITDA}}{\text{Sales}}$$This can be a better measure as it accounts accounts for non cash expenditures, better mirroring the [[Cash flows]] of the firm.
$$\text{Return on Assets (ROA)}=\frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Total Assets}}$$$$\text{Return on Equity (ROE)}=\frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Total Equity}}$$
##### Market Value Ratios
$$\text{Earnings Per Share (EPS)}=\frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$$$$\text{Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E ratio)}=\frac{\text{Price per Share}}{\text{EPS}}$$$$\text{Book Value per Share (BVPS)}=\frac{\text{Shareholder's Equity}}{\text{Shares Outstanding}}$$$$\text{Market to Book Ratio}=\frac{\text{Price per Share}}{\text{BVPS}}$$
$$\text{Market Capitalization}=\text{Price per Share}\times\text{Shares Outstanding}$$If the market cap is greater than the book value ([[Balance sheet#Shareholder's equity]]), the shares are selling at a premium.  
$$\text{Enterprise Value (EV)}=\text{Market Capitalization}+\text{Market value of interest bearing debt}-\text{Cash}$$$$\text{EV Multiple}=\frac{\text{EV}}{\text{EBITDA}}$$

### DuPont Identity
Empirical identity based on financial management experience. We know that $$\text{ROE}=\frac{\text{Net Income (NI)}}{\text{Total Equity (TE)}}$$$$=\frac{NI}{TE}\times\frac{TA}{TA}=\frac{NI}{TA}\times\frac{TA}{TE}$$Therefore,$$\text{ROE}=\text{ROA}\times\text{Equity Multiplier}$$Further,$$\text{ROE}=\frac{NI}{TA}\times\frac{TA}{TE}\times\frac{\text{Sales}}{\text{Sales}}=\frac{NI}{\text{Sales}}\times\frac{TA}{TE}\times\frac{\text{Sales}}{TA}$$$$\text{ROE}=\text{Profit Margin}\times\text{Equity Multiplier}\times \text{TAT}$$
