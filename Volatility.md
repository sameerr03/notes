Volatility of a strategy is a measure of the dispersion of returns for a given stock. It is generally a representation of risk. Volatility is typically measured from either [[Frequency distributions#Standard deviation]] or [[Frequency distributions#Variance ($ sigma 2$)]]. 

Volatility is given by the formula:
$$V=\sigma\sqrt{T}$$Where:
- $\sigma$ is the standard deviation
- $T$ is the number of periods in a time horizon. 

The formula for standard deviation assumes that the distribution of returns are normal. As [[Return Distributions]] are cauchy and not normal, the volatility does not capture any tail risk.

To annualize volatility, $T$ is given depending on the frequency of data
- for daily volatility $T=252$
- for weekly volatility $T=52$
- for monthly volatility $T=12$
