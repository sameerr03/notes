# Linear transformation
The [[Measures of central tendency|mean]] of a series can be linearly transformed easily via
$$y_i=Ax_i+B$$
Where A and B are constants

This results in n terms of y that can be averaged. Transforms the series linearly which results in new mean being:

$$\bar{y}=A\bar{x}+B$$

Similarly,  the [[Frequency distributions#Variance| variance]] of the series can undergo Linear transformation.

$$S_y^2=B^2S_x^2$$
