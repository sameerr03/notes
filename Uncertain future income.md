If $\beta=1$,
2 time periods, p1 and p2, where the income in p1 is Y and in p2 the income reduces by L with a probability $p_L$ or no reduction with the probabiility $1-p_L$
Therefore,
$c_1 \le m_1+m_2/(1+r)$
$c_1 \le m_1+\frac{Y-L}{1+r}$

If r=0,
$c_1\le 2Y-L$

This is the borrowing constraint. The maxinmum amount that can be consumed in period 1.

The [[vNm Expected utility]] function between the two periods will be
$$U(c_1)=v(c_1)+p_Lv(2Y-L-c_1)+(1-p_L)v(2Y-c_1)$$
$$U'(c_1)=v'(c_1)-p_Lv'(2Y-L-c_1)-(1-p_L)v'(2Y-c_1)=0$$
Using differenciation, the equation is converted into a quadratic equation. This equation can be solved in order to fins the opimal amount of consumption. One or both of the solutions can be ruled out by the borrowing constraint. If both, then corner solution.

if there was no risk, $c_1=c_2$ ie., consumption today = consumption tomorrow. With risk, MU is higher while taking c_1 less than c_2 as it accounts for future income shock related risks. Equalizing marginal utility across the two states is the optimal counsumption bundle of the two goods across the two states.
