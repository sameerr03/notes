# Consumption Smoothing
money can be used to smooth consumption over time. Consumption is the desire to not consume everyting in one go. Consumption smoothing is a basic source of stabilization of an economy.

The [[opportunity cost]] of having more goods now is having fewer goods later. [[borrowing]],[[lending]] and [[investment]] allow for rearranging the capacity to buy goods and services over time. Individuals usually have a preference for consuming both today and tomorrow.

The extent of consumption smoothing by and individual depends upon their preference for consumption smoothing and their impatience. The discount rate ($\rho$) is the measure of an indviduals' impatience.

**Diminishing marginal returns to consumption:** The value of an additional unit of consumption declines, the more consumption and individual has.

The saver consumption smooths by postponing consumption into the future. 

## Limitations
Limitations to this smoothening mean it cannot always stabilize the economy; it may amplify a [[shock]].
- Credit Constraints: Restrictions on the amount of money able to be borrowed. (no periods of borrowing)
- Weakness of will (inability to commit to saving plans in order to consumption smooth)
- Limitations in Co-insurance
