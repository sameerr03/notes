Ideas are **non rival goods**. Anyone can use ideas at the same point in time. They are excludable however, as they can be protected by royalties and patents. However, there are a lot of freely available ideas as well. 

When ideas are non-rival, this implies that ideas can be used with low/zero marginal costs, whereas take a long time to develop and implement, therefore have high fixed costs. With this combination, ideas have increasing [[technology#Returns to scale|returns to scale]]. The average cost reduces from an increase in the number of goods produced using the idea. Firms that innovate would not be able to compete as they would be out competed by those using the idea and taking advantage of the low Marginal cost that is always greater than the average cost. This requires ideas to be protected -> making coming up with new ideas a profitable venture.

This means that new production of ideas is supported by a larger population.
