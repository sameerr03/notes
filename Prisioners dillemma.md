A [[game]] in which the payoffs in the [[dominant stratergy equilibrium(DSE)]] are lower for each player, and also lower in total, than if neither player played their [[dominant stratergy]]. Playing the [[dominant stratergy]] in this situation leads to a socially sub-optimal payoff. 

Two prisioners are separated and given the choice not to or to rat out the other and based on their actions their sentence varies.

Players: $N=\{P_1,P_2\}$
Action Spaces: $A_{p_1}=\{C,NC\}$, $A_{p_2}=\{C,NC\}$  
Outcomes: $A_{p_1} \times A_{P_2}=$ C,C; C,NC; NC,C ; NC,NC  
Preferences are based on how many years of prision. The lower, the higher the utility.

Using a **payofff matrix**,

Determining the outcome:
Fixing the strategy for one player, the other has to confess(dominant strategy)  

A [[dominant stratergy equilibrium(DSE)]] is reached as both players play it, resulting in a socially sub optimal outcome.

[[public good]]s run the risk of being affected by the prisioners dillema. [[altruism]] among players of thepublic goods game can result in a breaking down of socially Sub optimal outcomes.
