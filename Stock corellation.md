Stocks price up and down can be corellated to the wider stock market. This is done using [[Simple Linear Regression]]. A stock with a beta$(\beta_i)$/slope value of 1 means that high points in the overall markets are high return points in the stock and so on. A beta above 1 implies an overreaction to the wider stock market and a beta below 1 is an underreaction. The regression is of the form
$$y=\beta x+\alpha$$Where:
- y is the return on the stock
- x is the return on the market
- $\beta$ is the [[Risk#Systematic risk]], or how much the stock co-moves with the market
