A [[Lotteries|lottery]] is represented by a point on the triangle. A point within the triangle has non zero or one probabilities for all three outcomes. A compound probability is the linear combination of two points (simple lottery)

#### [[indifference curves]] in the Marschak machina triangle
if for two [[Lotteries]], $p,q$ such that $p\sim q$, this implies that the [[vNm Expected utility]] $V(p)=V(q)$For the compound lottery $\alpha p+(1-\alpha) q$, the EU is $\alpha V(p)+(1-\alpha)V(q)=V(p)=V(q)$. Therefore, $V(p)=V(q)=V(\alpha p+(1-\alpha)q)$, implying that $p\sim q\sim \alpha p+(1-\alpha) q$. Therefore all linear combinations of two indifferent lotteries will be on the same IC. this means that the curves are linear. 

ICs of EU maximizers are parallel in the MM triangle. Assume $r\succ p,q$. Then for $\alpha p +(1-\alpha)r$ and $\alpha q+(1-\alpha)r$, these must be indifferent as $p\sim q\implies \alpha V(p)=\alpha V(q)$ by [[vNm Expected utility#Independence axiom|independence]]. Therefore since the probability weights are the same, this implies that the ICs must be parallel
