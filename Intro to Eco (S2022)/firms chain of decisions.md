The feasable frontier is the demand curve. It shows all economically feasable combinations of price and quantity. Slope=$\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta q}$

The ICs are isoprofit curves. The slope of the ICs are $\frac{p}{q}-\frac{w}{q}=\frac{p-w}{q}$ (price per unit - inputs per unit(wages))

The profit is maximized where the MRS=MRT. Once the price has been determined, the division of the revenue between profit and wages is determined
## Number of employees
The amount of production is known, therefore the amount of labour is easily determined.
