# Slutsky decomposition 
Slutsky decomposition breaks down [[Price effect]] into its components, [[Income effect]] and [[Substitution effect]].

To break down the overall effect, we create a hypothetical scenario keeping the real price constant (even though it actually changes as the goods price has reduced) so that the old optimal bundle remains just affordable.

## Using [[Optimization#Using Lagrangian multiplier N goods|optimal values]]
$$\hat{x}_n=\frac{\alpha\ m}{p_n}$$
Given that the price goes to $p_n'$, the price effect,$$\Delta=\frac{\alpha\ m}{p_n'}-\frac{\alpha\ m}{p_n}$$The substitution effect, governed by the change in price, not in real income will be $$\Delta^S=\frac{\alpha\ m'}{p_n'}-\frac{\alpha\ m}{p_n}$$
The Income effect governed slolely by real income change will be $$\Delta^I=\frac{\alpha\ m}{p_n'}-\frac{\alpha\ m'}{p_n'}$$
and the overall price effect$$\Delta=\Delta^S+\Delta^I$$
