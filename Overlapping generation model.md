Time is discrete, i.e., $t=1,2,3,...\infty$
In each period of time $t$, $N_t$ agents are born and live for 2 periods. Therefore in each period, there are 2 groups of people, the young and the old who were born in the previous period. The population progresses using this formula$$N_t=nN_{t-1}$$$n$ greater or lesser than 1 implies a growing or a shrinking population. 

Each young person is endowed with $y$ units of perishable goods (last one period only). When old there is no endowment => old people have no goods to consume in each time period. 

The agents will prefer to consume in both periods of their life. Their [[Utility function]] is the following$$U(c_{1,t},c_{2,t+1})=c_{1,t}^{\frac12}c_{2,t+1}^\frac12$$Solutions to this problem:
- [[social planner solution]]
- [[Decentralized record keeping based solution]]
- [[simple model of money]]
