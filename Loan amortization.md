Describes the types of ways in which loans can be paid back or [[Balance sheet#Depreciation and Amortization|amortized]]. 

##### Pure discount loan
The borrower receives money today and promises to pay back a single lump sum (interest and principal) at a future time. An example of this type of loan is a Treasury Bill (short term bond)

##### Interest only loans
Requires an interest payment at each period in time. At maturity (last interest payment) the principal is due. An example of this type of loan is government or corporate bonds. 

Eg: Suppose a 10000 interest only loan is taken at an interest rate of 7% for 5 years. In years 1 through 4, $0.07\times 10000=700$ is paid. In the fifth year, the loan has reached the 
maturity period and therefore the principal and the last interest amount 10700 is paid.

##### Amortized loans
The repayment of the principal happens over time, along with the payment of additional interest
