# Fairness
Fairness evaluates the rules and outcome of a [[game]], and by proxy the [[institutions]] that dictate the rules of the game.

There are two ways of judging fairness:
- **Substansive Judgement of Fairness**: Judgement based on the characteristics of the [[allocation]], not on how it was determined
- **Procedural judgement of fairness**: An evaluation of an outcome based on how the allocation came about and not on the characteristics of the outcome.

## Substansive Judgements
Judgements based on inequality in respect to allocations such as:
- Income
- Happiness
- Freedom

## Procedural Judgements
Judgements based on the rules of the game that brought about the allocations such as:
- Voluntary exchange of private property acquired by legitimate means
- Equal opportunity for economic advantage
- Deservingness

## Evaluating Fairness
Fairness is subjective - hence may not be as usefull as a standalone measure of evaluating allocations and [[institutions]].

### Rawls' veil of ignorance 
1. Fairness applies to all people - rules of fairness are constant
2. Imagine a veil of ignorance
3. Make a judgement behind the veil
This method of evaluating fairness can be quite easily subject to disagreement

### Role of economics
Economics cannot provide judgements of fairness but based on criteria, economics can clarify 
- how unfairness can be connected (how institutions affect inequality)
- tradeoffs in the fairness of outcomes (tradeoff between one aspect of fairness and another)
- which policies can address unfairness and how
