# Biases
Bias create incorrect associations between exposure and outcome
## Types of Biases
**Information bias**
Information bias results from incorrect information. The sources of this incorrect information are:
- Measuring inaccuracies
- The misreporting from study participant of something not verifiable
- A misinterpretation of results
- Incorrect recording of results

**Selection bias**
An error when the participants for a study is not representative of the target population. Can occur when participants are not chosen randomly

**Attrition bias**
Exists if the characteristics of  study participants who are lost to follow up differ between the treatment groups or observational cohorts

**Recall bias**
occurs when one group has a different recall of exposures or events before the onset of disease

**Observation bias**
occurs when a patient behaves differently because they are aware that they are being observed

**Misclassification Bias** 
is a process that produces error in the information about disease exposure and/or outcome

**Confounding bias**
Systematic distortion in the measure of association between exposure and the health outcome caused by mixing the effect of the exposure of primary interest with extraneous risk factors.

#### Confirmation bias
Individual has an initial belief. The individual can interpret evidence in the manner that supports the initial belief.
