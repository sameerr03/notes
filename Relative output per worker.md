growth of countries can be analysed using relative incomes per worker. $$\hat y_i=\frac{y_i}{y_{US}}$$Where $\hat y_i$ is the output per worker of a country $i$ relatve to a rich country like the US. Expanding the equation, assuming $g$ is constant for both countries, $$\hat y_i=\frac{A_ie^{\psi u_i}(\frac{s_i}{\delta+n_i+g})^{\alpha/(1-\alpha)}}{A_{US}e^{\psi u_{US}}(\frac{s_{US}}{\delta+n_{US}+g})^{\alpha/(1-\alpha)}}$$$$=\frac{A_i}{A_{US}}e^{\psi (u_i-u_{US})}(\frac{s_i}{s_{US}})^{\alpha/(1-\alpha)}(\frac{\delta+n_{US}+g}{\delta+n_i+g})^{\alpha/(1-\alpha)}$$
Assuming technology to be the same, the model shows a discrepancy with actual data. This is explained by the [[Solow residual]]
