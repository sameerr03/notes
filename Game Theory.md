A method of using a [[game]] to predict the outcome of a social interaction (see: [[Social Interactions]])

### Requirements for a game
- A set of players  
- Rules of the game: -> leads to action spaces, the potential actions that a player can take  
- Outcomes: cartesian product of all the action spaces between the players (all combinations of player choices)  
- [[Utility]]: Utility can be given to each outcome for each player in order to determine their preference over outcomes.
$$G=(I,S,u)$$where I is players, S is stratergy profiles and u is the associated utility with each outcome.

### Determining outcomes
[[Belief]]s or [[Equilibrium]]s can be used to find the outcome of a particular game. However, using equillibriums assumes that Beliefs are always correct and there is no [[Probability|probabiity]] distribution, the player beilives that the other players play a certain outcome with a probability of 1. As probabilities are now certain, EU does not matter.

### Representation of games
There are two forms of [[game]]s based on when players can take their respective actions
- [[Normal form games]] 
- [[extensive form games]]
