Another way to model non-Bayesian DMs is through multiple prior models. DM might not be able to capture perception about the relevant uncertainty with a single prior (subjective probability - instead a range of priors).

$\succsim$ on $F$ has an MEU representation if there exists
- a non-empty, closed, and convex set of $C$ of finitely additive probability measures on $S$
- a non-constant utility function $u:X\to\mathbb R$
such that the function $U:F\to\mathbb R$, given by$$U(f)-\text{min}_{\mu\in C}\sum_{s\in S}\mu(s)u(fs)$$
