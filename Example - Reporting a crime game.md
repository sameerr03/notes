Crowd of people witnessing a crime. $-c$ utility for calling the police per person. $+v$ if the police is called. Everyone benefits from the police being called. At least one person faces slight disutility. 
$S_i=\{NC,C\}$
$u_i=\{C,S_{-i}$ at least one person calls$\}=v-c$
$u_i=\{NC,S_{-i}$ at least one person calls$\}=v$
$u_i=\{C,S_{-i}$ no one calls$\}=v-c$
$u_i=\{NC,S_{-i}$ no one calls$\}=0$

Expected payoffs for player $i$
$EU_i(C,\sigma_{-i})=P($police is informed$)[v-c]+P($police not informed$)(-c)=v-c$
$EU_i(NC,\sigma_{-i})=P($police is informed$)v+P($police not informed$)0$

If $(1-p)^{n-1}$ is the probability that no one calls the police, $1-(1-p)^{n-1}$ is the probability that at least one person calls.

$EU_i(NC,\sigma_{-i})=[1-(1-p)^{n-1}]v$

For the mixed stratergy probabity,
$$v-c=[1-(1-p)^{n-1}]v$$$$p=1-(\frac cv)^{\frac{1}{n-1}}$$
