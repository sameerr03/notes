The government can take a [[Direct tax]] from the old people instead of printing money to get [[seigniorage revenue]] in the [[Overlapping generation model]]. This results in new budget constraints in the [[simple model of money]].

In period $t$, for the young
$$c_{1,t}+v_tm_t\le y$$In period $t+1$, for the old
$$c_{2,t+1}\le v_{t+1}m_t-\tau_{t+1}$$As the government is not printing money, $z=1$. This means that from the market clearing condition, $$\frac{v_t}{v_{t+1}}=\frac 1n$$In the young budget constraint,$$\frac 1{v_t}c_{1,t}+m_t\le\frac{y}{v_t}$$Similarly, in the old budget constraint,$$\frac1{v_{t+1}}c_{2,t+1}\le m_t-\frac1{v_{t+1}}\tau_{t+1}$$$$\frac1{v_{t+1}}c_{2,t+1}+\frac1{v_{t+1}}\tau_{t+1}\le m_t$$
This means that $$\frac 1{v_t}c_{1,t}+\frac1{v_{t+1}}c_{2,t+1}+\frac1{v_{t+1}}\tau_{t+1}\le\frac 1{v_t}c_{1,t}+m_t\le\frac{y}{v_t}$$Therefore,$$c_{1,t}+\frac{v_t}{v_{t+1}}c_{2,t+1}+\frac{v_t}{v_{t+1}}\tau_{t+1}\le y$$From the market clearing condition,$$\frac{v_t}{v_{t+1}}=\frac{(N_t(y-c_1)/M_t)}{(N_{t+1}(y-c_1)/M_{t+1})}=\frac{N_t}{N_{t+1}}=\frac 1n$$(as $z=1$)
Therefore, the LTBC becomes $$c_{1,t}+\frac1nc_{2,t+1}\le y-\frac1n\tau_{t+1}$$At SME, $$c_1+\frac 1nc_2\le y-\frac1n \tau$$
#### Welfare comparison
From the [[centralized solution with government spending]], we know that $$g=\frac{G_t}{N_t}=\frac{N_{t-1}\tau_t}{N_t}=\frac 1n \tau$$As the income of the government is based on the tax paid by all the old people.
$$c_1+\frac 1nc_2\le y-g$$$$c_1+\frac1nc_2\le y-\frac 1n \tau$$Thus the feasibility set is the exact same as the budget set. There is no welfare loss from the optimal centralized solution when the government takes a direct tax.
