There are two choice problems,
$p=[100000]$ and $q=[500000,\frac 1{10}; 100000, \frac {89}{100};0, \frac 1{100}]$
$p'=[100000,\frac {11}{100};0,\frac{89}{100}]$ and $q'=[500000,\frac 1{10};0, \frac {9}{10}]$

It is reasonable that a DM would choose $p\succ q$ and $q'\succ p'$. However, these preferences are not consistent with [[vNm Expected utility]].

Due to [[vNm Expected utility#Independence axiom|independence]], we only need to compare the lower branches of the trees.

$q,q'$ and $p,p'$ are similar. However, the choices of the DM are inconsistent. This could be because the events are not separable due to perceived disappointment of getting zero in the $q$ of the first CP.

These indifference curves show fanning out (ics starting from a point outside the triangle and fanning out), which violate how [[Marschak machina triangle#indifference curves in the Marschak machina triangle]|ICs on MM triangle]] are.
