The common multiples used for comp based stock valuation is given by 
1. [[Ratio analysis#Market Value Ratios|P/E ratio]]
2. [[Ratio analysis#Market Value Ratios|Enterprise Value Ratios]]

Here, the multiples are calculated from other companies, typically in the same industry or with similar business models (average of the ratios of those companies)
#### P/E Ratio
$$\text{Implied Share Price}=\text{P/E Multiple}\times\text{EPS}$$

typically, when the P/E ratio of a company is less than the industry P/E ratio, then there is an expectation that in the long run it will meet the industry average. As a result this could be a good time to buy the stock. However, further investigation into the low P/E needs to be done

P/E does not take into accounts debt payments, borrowing and the overall liquidity of a company, therefore is not a complete analysis

#### EV Ratios
Based on the [[Ratio analysis#Market Value Ratios|EV Ratio]] average for comparable companies, a multiple can be used to value the stock of a company $$\text{Implied Share Price}=\text{EV Multiple}\times\text{EBITDA}$$
