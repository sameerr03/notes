# Liquidity trap
when intrest rates are very low, [[Monetary policy]] (outward movement of LM curve) does not work as intrest is lower bounded by 0 (Zero lower bound).

A zero interest would mean that there would be no bonds as people would only hold liquid money.

In a liquidity trap, equilibrium output is low and monetary policy is innaffective. Because of expectations of deflation, there is no investment as well.
