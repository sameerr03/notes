2 groups of people, each asked a [[Lotteries|lottery]] related question. In the first group either 3000 with a probability of 1 or 4000 with a probability of 0.8 and 0 with a probability of 0.2

In the second group chooses between either 3000 with a probability of 0.25 and 0 with a probability of 0.75 or 4000 with a probability of 0.2 and 0 with a probability of 0.8

the first group preferred 3000 over (4000,0.8,0,0.2)
the second group preferred (4000,0.25,0,0.75) over (3000,0.2,0,0.8)

In the first lottery, $$u(3000)\succ0.8u(4000)+0.2u(0)$$
In the second lottery,$$0.25u(3000)+0.75u(0)\prec0.2u(4000)+0.8u(0)$$$$\implies0.25u(3000)\prec0.2u(4000)+0.05u(0)$$$$\implies4\times 0.25u(3000)\prec4\times(0.2u(4000)+0.05u(0))$$$$\implies u(3000)\prec0.8u(4000)+0.20u(0)$$However, this is inconsistent with the first lottery. Therefore Expected utility is not consistent.
