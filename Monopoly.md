Situation where only one [[firm]] sells output. Their function then becomes$$max_y\ \pi=p(y)y-c(y)$$
As a monopolist, either the price or the quantitiy of the good to be produced can be decided by the firm, the demand function decides the rest. Optimising,$$p'(y)y+p(y)-c'(y)=0$$$$p'(y)y+p(y)=c'(y)$$
The marginal cost = the marginal revenue (slope of price into quantity). Substituting the [[Comparitive statics#Price elasticity of demand|demand elasticity]], we get$$p(y)[1-\frac{1}{\epsilon}]=MC$$=>$$p(y)=\frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{\epsilon}}MC$$
This is the **markup equation**. If $\epsilon>1$ then the price is greater than the marginal cost, implying that the monopolist is overcharging for a good. There is a [[Gains from trade#Deadweight loss|deadweight loss]] as the producers gains from trade increases and the consumers shrinks while being constrained by a demand function. 

### Price discrimination
selling same product to different consumers at different prices.  The types are
- 1st degree (perfect) -> charge at the marginal willingness to pay (no consumer surplus)  
- 2nd degree -> different prices for different number of units bought (bulk discount)
- 3rd degree -> Markers for different groups of consumers (student discounts, etc.)
