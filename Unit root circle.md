A circle that plots the values of the [[Difference equations#Finding solutions of difference equations|roots]]. The $x$ axis represents real numbers while the $y$ axis represents the imaginary component of complex numbers. 

- If roots of the different equation $<1$ in absolute terms, then the roots lie within the unit root circle
- If the roots of the [[Difference equations]] =1, they lie on the unit root circle
- If the roots of the [[Difference equations]]>1 in absolute terms, they lie outside the unit root circle


If a [[Time Series]] follows a trend, it has at leas one unit root.
