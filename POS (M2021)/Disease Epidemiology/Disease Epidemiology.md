# Disease Epidemiology
##  The Basics of Epidemiology
-   Diseases epidemiology is the study of how [[Diseases]] are distributed in **populations** and factors that influence or determine this distribution
-   Population: Complete collections of individuals that have some characteristic in common
-   Frequency of occurrence of a disease in a population governed by interaction of a large number of different determinants.
-   Population at Risk: A subset of the original, defined population and comprises the total number of individuals in that original population considered capable of acquiring the particular disease or disease characteristic being studied.

-  Agents include infectious agents (Pathogens) like Viruses and Bacteria
-  Host Factors:
	- Overall heath
	-   Immune status
	-   Age
	-   Underlying health conditions
	-   Nutrition
	-   Genetics (see: [[Genes]])
-   Environmental Factors:
	-   Climate
	-   Physical Environment
	-   Geography
	-   Social Conditions (Crowding, poverty)
-   A disease **Vector** is any living agent that carries and transmits an infectious athogen to another living organism

These factors behind diseases are studied using the various types of [[Epidemiological Studies]].
