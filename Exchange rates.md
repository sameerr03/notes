**Nominal exchange rate ($E$)**:: Number of units of foreign currency that can be bought for one unit of domestic currency. 

When the domestic currency becomes more valuable (E increases). This is the :: **appreciation of exchange rates.** Imports become more lucrative in this case as more can be bought for the same money. Demand for exports falls, therefore net exports reduces.

When the domestic currency becomes less valuable (E decreases). This is the :: **depreciation of exchange rates.** Imports become far less lucrative as less can now be bought for the same money. Demand for exports increases, therefore net exports increases.

### The two types of exchange rates
-   **fixed** :: E is fixed, pegged to a foreign currency
-   **floating**:: E is not fixed, changes through net exports (imports have to be bought with foreign currency(reduces relative value)).

### Real exchange rate

The real exchange rate ($\epsilon$) is :: $$\epsilon=E\ \cdot \frac{P_d}{P_f}$$
Where:
- $P_d$ is the domestic prices
- $P_f$ is the foreign prices

An increase in the price ratio between domestic and foreign prices is **real exchange rate appreciation** and the decrease is **real exchange rate depreciation**.

### Multilateral Exchange rate

**Multilateral exchange rates** :: Weighted average of the real exchange rates with each trade partner of an economy with multiple trade partners. The weighted average is based on % of total trade with that economy.
