[[Rational Shortlist method (RSM)|RSMs]] and [[Rational Choice theory]] both assume that the DM considers all feasible alternatives from the set $X$ when they make their choice. However, many real world DMs have limited attention and may not consider all feasible alternatives. 

In order to account for this, there is a consideration set $\subseteq X$, which has all the alternatives that the DM considers. 

Consider the choice function,
$c(xy)=x; c(yz)=y; c(xz)=x; c(xyz)=y$

|Menu|consideration set|preference $x\succ y\succ z$|
|---|---|---|
|xy|xy|x|
|yz|yz|y|
|xz|xz|x|
|xyz|yz|y|

$x$ is not in the consideration set in the 3 alternative menu. 

Let $S\in X$. The DM does not pay attention to all alternatives in $S$. $\Gamma(S)$ is the (nonempty) set of the alternatives to which the DM pays attention. $\Gamma:\chi\to\chi$ is a consideration set mapping if for all $$S\in \chi,\ \emptyset\ne\Gamma(S)\subseteq S$$However, if there are no restrictions on $\Gamma$, all choices can be explained by a change in consideration set, rendering the model having no predictive power.
