When projects are funded by stocks and bonds, the firm will incur issue costs. These are floatation costs. 

The weighted average floatation cost is given by $$f_o = \frac SV\times f_S+\frac BV\times f_B$$where:
- $f_S$ is the floatation cost of stock
- $f_B$ is the floatation cost of bonds
- $\frac SV$ and $\frac BV$ are the percentage of stock and bonds respectively
