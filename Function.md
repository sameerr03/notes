A [[Relations|relation]] that maps 2 [[Set theory|sets]] (the domain to the co-domain). The notation for a function is $$f:X\to Y$$A function also maps every $x\in X$ to a $y\in Y$, and is not one:many (one $x$ maps to multiple $y$). The smallest possible co-domain is called the range.

#### Types of functions
- surjection - many:1 function, but the co-domain is equal to the range![[Pasted image 20240829194226.png|400]]
- injection - 1:1 function, but the co-domain is not equal to the range. This means that every element in the set $Y$ does not have a pre image in $X$ ($y\in Y, f^{-1}(y)=\{x\in X\}$)![[Pasted image 20240829194414.png|400]]
- bijection - 1:1 function but the co-domain is equal to the range. Every element in $Y$ has an existing pre-image in $X$.

Injective, surjective and bijective functions are all dependent on the domain, co-domain and range definition - without changing the form of the function. Bijective function maps always have an inverse.
