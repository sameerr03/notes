The mundell fleming model is an expansion of the [[ISLM model]]. It shows all points of equillibrium in the goods and money market sides of an **open economy**. In an open economy, the [[net exports]] is dependant on the [[Exchange rates]]. The equation for output in an open economy is thus:$$Y=C(Y)+I(r)+G+NX(e)$$
### Assumptions
1. The economy is small and open - The country cannot impact world interest rates. As a result domestic interest rates $r=r*$.  if r is greater than r*, demand for bonds rises due to perfect capital mobility. When bonds are issued and money is gained, money supply increases, reducing interest rates untill r= r*. similarly if r<r*, demand is low, money supply decreases â†’ [[LM curve]]  moves inwards and r increases till r= r*.
2. Floating system for exchange rates - The exchange rates are not fixed. They are variable according to market conditions. 
3. Perfect capital mobility - Foreign investors can take all their bonds out of one economy and put it into another with no losses/consequences. 

### Goods Market side
$$PE=C(Y-T)+I(r*)+G+NX(e)$$
The interest rate is fixed. The only parameter for change is the exchange rate.

### Money market side
For a small open economy, $$(\frac{M}{P})^s=L(r*,Y)$$

As r is fixed to r*, LM does not change. r* is independant of e. As a result the LM curve is independant of e. 

### Combined equillibrium

For a small open economy with perfect capital mobility, the mundell fleming model is

### Policy effects
#### [[Fiscal Policy]]
Expansionary fiscal policy results in the outward shift of the IS curve, increasing exchange rates but keeping Y constant.

With an increase in G or a reduction in T in the [[Keynesian cross]], PE Shifts upwards and Y increases to Y2. With an increase in Y, Money demand curve shifts outwards and as a result, r goes above r* -> with an increase in r, foreign investors buy and demand the local currency and bonds. With this increase in domestic currency, the money supply increases -> r falls back to r*.

During this process, in the foreign exchange (forex) market, the demand for the domestic currency increases, resulting in the exchange rate increaseing -> net exports decreases -> PE falls -> Y2 falls back to Y*

#### [[Monetary policy]]

With an increase in Money supply -> r goes below r* -> foreign investors sell their domestic bonds -> demand for domestic currency reduces in the forex market -> exchnage rate falls, along with a reduction in money supply as domestic money is exchanged for foreign money by investors -> r goes back to r*, NX increases as E falls -> Y increases.

#### Trade policy
Trade policy changes the Net exports curve by changing imports or exports (eg: import restrictions)
![[Pasted image 20221125235548.png|400]]
With a restriction on imports, net exports increases at the same exchange rate. This leads to an increase in Y as NX increases. This leads to a chain reaction as follows:
Y increases -> Money demand increases -> r goes above r* ->foreign currency exchanged for domestic -> exchange rates rise, Money supply rises and as a result r falls back to r* -> NX falls with an increase in E by the same amount that it had increased by -> Y falls back to the original level as a result.

This is summarised in the mundell fleming model by the graph
