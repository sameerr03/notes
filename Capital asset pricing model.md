Any asset $i$ follows the equation $$r_i=r_f+\beta_i(r_m-r_f)$$Where:
- $r_i$ is the expected return of the asset $i$
- $r_f$ is the return on the risk free rate (government bonds)
- $r_m$ is the expected return on the overall market
- $\beta_i$ is the [[Risk#Systematic Risk]] of the asset obtained from [[Stock corellation]]

This model implies that higher returns on assets are from higher betas. However, this also implies that more systematic risk was taken on. Using assets of many different betas across a [[portfolio]] is necessary to minimize [[Risk]] across an entire portfolio.
