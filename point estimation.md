Using the value of a [[sample]] statistic in order to estimate the value of a [[Population]] parameter is called **point estimation**. The statistic is the point estimate.

Law of large numbers: Larger sample sizes tend to [[Frequency distributions#Normal distributions|Normal distributions]].

Properties of an estimator:
- Unbiasedness : for all values of x, if $E(\bar{X})=\mu_{pop}$ then it is unbiased
- Efficiency :: In all the unbiased estimators, the one with the least variance are the most efficient/best.
- consistency: The estimator, $\hat{\theta}$ approaches the population parameter $(\theta)$ as n â†’tends to $\infty$.

The point estimator does not estimate the population parameter but an interval close to it based on [[Estimation of population mean|confidence]].
