# Price Setting Curve
The **price setting curve** gives the [[real wage]] paid when firms choose their profit-maximizing price. Determined by the [[firms chain of decisions]]
The Price setting curve depends on:
- competition: competition determines markup
- labour-productivity: determined the real wage for given markup

Unit labour costs $\frac{W}{\lambda}$ W= nominal wages, $\lambda$=avg. productivity of labour.

Firm chooses its price such that its markup over price = 1/[[price elasticity of demand]] (derived from MRS=MRT relation in [[firms chain of decisions]])

$$\mu =\frac{p-c}{p}=\frac{1}{e_p}$$
$$\mu =\frac{p-\frac{W}{\lambda}}{p}$$
$$\frac{W}{p} =\lambda-\lambda\mu$$
$$\frac{W}{p} =\lambda(1-\mu)$$
real wage = output per worker - real profit per worker
if P is the average price level in the economy, real wage = W/P

For the economy, (if the entire economy is made up of firms facing competition conditions like the first firm)
$$\frac{W}{P} =\lambda(1-\mu)$$
The output per worker = real wage+profit

The price setting curve gives the [[real wage]]when firms choose their profit maximising price
