$G=(I,T,p,S,u_i)$
Where,
- T is the types of private information available to each players. 
- p is the probability distribution of all the types of playes

In the approaching game example,

Turning this into a bayesian normal form of the game, we fill in the payoffs of the table with expected utility values as the utility is determined by the probability in type selection. Doing so,

|1/2|YY'|YN'|NY'|NN'|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|A|10, 2p+6|12p-2, 2+6p|10-12p, 6+4p|-2, 2+8p|
|NA|0,0|0,0|0,0|0,0|

Where Y is for the choice if player 2 has the type V and Y' is the choice if player 2 has the type NV
