Growth according to the [[Solow model-with technology|solow model]] encourages higher savings rates, but this does not provide utility to workers, making it redundant.  
In order to maximise consumption per worker, Assuming no technology$$C+I=Y$$$$C=Y-I$$$$C=Y-sY$$Dividing by labour throughout,$$c=y-sy$$In the steady state,$$c=y-(\delta+n)k$$$$c=k^\alpha-(\delta+n)k$$Maximising consumption per worker,$$max\ c\to\frac{dc}{dk}=\alpha k^{\alpha-1}-(\delta+n)=0$$$$\alpha k^{\alpha-1}_{gold}*=\delta+n$$Using the $k^*_{gold}$ as the steady state value, the savings can be adjusted in order to maximise consumption per worker

### With technology
Upon adding [[technology]] to it, investment per worker becomes$$i=s\tilde k^\alpha*=(\delta+n+g)\tilde k*$$$$\tilde c=\tilde k*^\alpha-(\delta+n)\tilde k*$$$$\alpha \tilde k*^{\alpha-1}_{gold}=\delta+n+g$$
