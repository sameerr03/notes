**Inflation** is the :: increase in the general price level in an economy over two consecutive periods
<!--SR:!2022-11-05,10,250-->
The rate of inflation in terms of nominal and real interest rates is given by$$(1+r_{money})=(1+r_{real})(1+i)$$where $i$ is the rate of inflation. 
Deflation is the :: decrease in general price level 
<!--SR:!2022-11-14,14,230-->
*disinflation* is the :: decrease in the rate of deflation. 
<!--SR:!2022-11-01,1,230-->

Real Interest rate = Nominal Interest Rate - Inflation Rate

Inflation tends to be lower during recessions (high unemployment). Inflation tends to be much higher in poorer countries

## Parameters of inflation
- Expected inflation - Increase in expectations of inflation leads to an increase in inflation. 
- Unemployment- Increase in unemployment leads to a decrease in inflation. Deflation results in firms reducing prices as intermediate goods are cheaper, and the demand at original prices is lower. In the short run, production can only be adjusted by changing labour, increasing unemployment because of reduced demand
- supply shocks - increase leads to increase in inflation. positive supply shock - sudden reduction in the supply ⇒ rise in prices leading to inflation

These parameters result in inflation through the [[Phillips curve]] equation $$\pi= E\pi - \beta (u- u^n ) + \mu$$
### Determinants of inflation through these parameters
- $Y-\bar{Y}>0$ (demand is high) → $u-u^n<0$ → $\pi$ increases is called :: demand pull inflation. Increasing output has the undesired effect of increasing inflation

- $\mu>0$ -> $\pi$ increase is called :: cost push inflation

## Effects of Inflation
- Lower value of real income for those fixed on nominal income
- Reduces the real value of debt (good for borrowers, bad for lenders)
- High inflation is volatile -> uncertainty in decision making
- It is harder for producers to distinguish between changes in relative prices and deflation

## Effects of deflation
- falling prices wil result in consumption being postponed as prices will become cheaper, can result in a negative shock to [[aggregate demand]].
- Deflation increases the real debt burden -> households cut consumption to reac their target wealth

## Causes of Inflation
Inflation arises from conflict among economic actors. It results from an increase in the prices of goods and nominal wages based on the following reasons:
- **Increase in [[firm]]s' bargaining power over workers (fall in competition).** Firms increase price of goods due to lack of competition, leading to fall in [[real wage]]. In order to keep workers happy, nominal wage goes up, resulting in inflation. 
- **Increase in workers' bargaining power over firms (lower unemployment/unions).** lower unemployment means the real wage moves up the [[wage setting curve]], leading to higher markup from the firm to compensate, resulting in inflation. Stronger unions can result in the wage setting curve moving up
- **An increase in [[aggregate demand]] results in inflation.** Higher demand results in firms becoming capacity constrained as their machines are fully utilized. Prices increase as a result leading to a wage price spiral. This increased demand can be because of increase in incomes, decreased interest rates (makes investments and depositing money less attractive). Lower inerest rates increase demads resulting in inflation again. 
- Supply shocks increase the relative demand of the good, leading to an increase in price, resulting in a wage-price spiral.

## Measuring Inflation
- Consumer Price Index (CPI): measures the general level of prices that consumers must pay for goods and services, including consumption taxes. Inflation = change in CPI
- [[Gross Domestic Product]] Deflator: (ratio of nominal to real GDP)

## Setting Inflation Rates

[[Fiscal Policy|Fiscal]] and [[Monetary policy]] changes the [[LM curve]] → changing [[aggregate demand curve|AD]] → changing $Y$ above or below $\bar{Y}$ → changes $u$ lower or higher than $u^n$ ([[Okun's law]]) → changes inflation rate

Government indirectly changes inflation rates.
