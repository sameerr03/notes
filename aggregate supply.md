[[Classical economics|classical economists]] belived that the AS curve was vertical line, keynes belived it was horizontal. AS is upward sloping accourding to the new keynesian approach. 

The equation of the of AS curve is$$Y=\bar{Y}+\alpha(P-EP)$$
Where:
- $\bar{Y}$ is the full employment or the natural rate of employment (equillibrium employment)
- $EP$ is the expected price
- $P-EP$ are the frictions in the economy that do not allow short term changes in price
- $\alpha$ is the sensitivity of Y to P

if $Y>\bar{Y}$, prices are greater than expected, economy is in a boom
if $Y<\bar{Y}$, prices are less than expected, economy is in a recession

## Cause of frictions
Frictions in the economy result in prices not changing as predicted by classical economists. The reasons behind this are the 
- [[sticky price model]]
- [[imperfect information model]]
