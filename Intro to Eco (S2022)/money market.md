# Money Market
[[bank]]s can borrow money from other banks or the central bank if their base money is less than the net transacted at an instance. This is called the money market.

Savers in the economy can contribute to the money market by investing in the government through bonds. 

Since central banks control the supply of [[base money]], it can determine the interest rate that it lends at. This becomes the reservation options for commercial banks to borrow. They will also not lend at a lower rate. The interest rate fixed by the central bank is the **policy rate**.

## Effects of the money market on the interest rate
In order to make profits, banks will lend to firms and households at rates higher than the policy rate in order for profits to be made i.e., the bank lending rate (average interest rate of commercial banks) is higher than the policy rate.
