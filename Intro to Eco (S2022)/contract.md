# Contract
A legal document or understanding that specifies a set of actions that parties to the contract must undertake

Contracts are often **incomplete**. This is because:
- a company will never fully know all that is required of an employee in the future and hence cannot contractually oblige it. 
- Information need not always be verifiable, especially by a third party
- Factors like effort are hard to measure and quantify
- An incomplete contract may be preffered
- Absence of judiciary

With the impracticalities that come with incomplete contracts, they allow for [[employment rent]], as with a complete contract the employer would have offered one that was just about acceptable, giving virtually no rent to the employee.
