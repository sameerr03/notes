In order to model investor preferences to understand prices and purchase decisions of [[Financial Assets]], we use the utility function
$$U(\mathbb{E}(r),\sigma^2)=\mathbb{E}(r)-\frac12A\sigma^2$$Where:
- $A$ is the investors measure of risk aversion
- $\sigma^2$ is the variance in the returns of the asset, used as a measure of risk
- $\frac 12$ is included for convenience while differentiating

Risk should lower utility more if the investor is risk averse than if the investor is risk neutral. therefore risk averse investors have a positive value of $A$, and risk neutral investors have $A=0$. 

Using this utility function, we can infer the investors indifference curves.

The curves are upward sloping for a risk averse investor as an investor will only be indifferent on the asset if a higher level of risk is compensated by a higher expected return. The direction of improvement is northwest as higher levels of expected returns with lower risk is obviously preferred.
