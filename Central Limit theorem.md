The **central limit theorem** states that the sum of a large number of independant random variables has a distribution that is approximately normal. 

If $X_1,X_2,........,X_n$ are a [[sample]] from a [[Population]] of [[random variables|mean]] $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, for a large n (greater than 30), the distribution of $X_1+X_2+........+X_n$ is approximately [[types of random variables|normal]] with mean $n\mu$ and variance $n\sigma^2$. This implies that$$Z=\frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}$$
As $n$ becomes larger, the PMF becomes more "normal"
