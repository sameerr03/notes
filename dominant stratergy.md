A [[Game Theory|player]] has a **dominant stratergy** when irrespective of the actions of other players, the player has only one strategy that is optimum. An [[Game Theory#Finding the outcome of a game|equillibrium]] of dominant stratergies when all players play it is a dominant stratergy equillibrium.

##### Strictly dominant stratergy
A stratergy $s_i \in S_i$ is strictly dominant if for every $s_{-i} \in S_{-i}$ we have $$u(s_i,s_{-i})>u(s_i',s_{-i})$$
###### Strictly dominated stratergy
A stratergy $s_i \in S_i$ is strictly dominated if $\exists\ s_i'\in S_i$ such that for every $s_{-i}\in S_{-i}$,$$u(s_i,s_{-i})<u(s_i',s_{-i})$$
##### Weakly dominant stratergy
A stratergy $s_i \in S_i$ is weakly dominant if for every $s_{-i} \in S_{-i}$ we have 
$$u(s_i,s_{-i})\ge u(s_i',s_{-i})$$with a **strict inequality for at least one** $s_{-i}\in S_{-i}$

###### Weakly dominated stratergy
A stratergy $s_i \in S_i$ is strictly dominated if $\exists\ s_i'\in S_i$ such that for every $s_{-i}\in S_{-i}$ we have,$$u(s_i,s_{-i})\le u(s_i',s_{-i})$$
with a **strict inequality for at least one** $s_{-i}\in S_{-i}$
