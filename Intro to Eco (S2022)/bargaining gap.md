At labour market [[Intro to Eco (S2022)/equillibrium]], prices are stable. When unemployment is below equillibrium(B), firms' claims to real profit + workers' claim to real wage > total productivity. Results in an upwards wage spiral, leading to [[inflation]]. Opposite if unemployment is below equillibrium.
