Too many choices can overwhelm the DMs , and as a result they can neglect some choices that they would otherwise prefer. This can be modelled through the assumption that when a DM is overwhelmed by an abundance of options, they may not be able to [[Consideration set|consider]] all the available alternatives but rather only a subset of them. Each alternative competes for the DMs attention, and as a result, the more alternatives, the more severe the [[competition filter|competiton]].
