Value investing is an investing approach that uses value disparities in stocks as a basis for making a trade as opposed to the changes in price. It involves picking stocks that appear to be trading for less than their intrinsic value based on [[Fundamental Analysis]]. These are stocks that the stock market is underestimating. This is built on the assumption that the undervalued stock will eventually return to its accurate position.
