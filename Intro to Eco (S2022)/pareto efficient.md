# Pareto Efficiency
A method of evaluating [[institutions]] and outcomes (allocations)

An allocation is **Pareto efficient** if nobody can be better off without making someone else worse off. Mathematically, allocation $(\tilde{x}^A,\tilde{x}^B)$ is pareto efficient if there does not exist an allocation $(\tilde{y}^A,\tilde{y}^B)$ such that $$u^A(\tilde{y}^A)>u^A(\tilde{x}^A)$$ and $$u^B(\tilde{y}^B)>u^B(\tilde{x}^)$$
An allocation A is **Pareto dominant** over B if atleast one party is better off with A without making any other parties worse off. Tangential [[indifference curves|ICs]] are pareto optimal. in the [[exchange equillibrium]] model,

Y is pareto dominant over X. At Y the MRS of ICa is equal to the MRS of ICb

## Pareto efficiency curve
Set of all parato efficient allocations (aka contract curve). Joins all points in the feasable set where MRS=MRT. Here CD is the pareto efficiency curve

The combined surplus is the same but the distribution is differnt

in the [[exchange equillibrium]] model, all points where ICa and ICb have the same MRS form the contract curve.

## Problems with Pareto efficiency
- It is possible to have more than one parato efficient allocation. 
- The criterion cannot allow us to choose among these allocations. 
- Pareto efficiency is unrelated to [[fairness]] as many allocations that are unfair could be parato efficient.
