A group is a [[Set theory|set]] along with the binary operation $*$, denoted as $(G,*)$ that assigns to each ordered pair $(a,b)$ of elements of $G$ an element in $G$ denoted by $a*b$ (Closure). We can say that $G$ is a group under this binary operation if the following properties are satisfied
1. Closure: $\forall\ x,y\in G, x*y\in G$
2. Associativity: $(x*y)*z=x*(y*z), \forall\ x,y,z\in G$
3. Existence of identity: $e\in G$ such that $x*e=e*x=x, \forall x\in G$
4. Existence of inverse: $\forall\ x\in G,\ \exists\ y\in G$ s.t. $x*y=y*x=e$

A group is a **Abelian** if $x*y=y*x,\ \forall\ x,y\in G$
