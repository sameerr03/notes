WARP of Weak Axiom of [[revealed preferences]] can be used to determine if revealed preferences are based on [[Rational Choice theory]].

If the DM chooses $x$ in some [[Rational Choice theory|menu]] with both $x$ and $y$ present, then the DM never chooses $y$ in any menu where $x$ is present. Formally, this is written as$$\text{For all }A,B\in\chi\text{ and } x,y\in A\cap B,x\ne y$$$$x=c(A)\implies y\ne c(B)$$This axiom can also be written as [[Independence of irrelevant alternatives]]. WARP implies that the preferences will have **No binary cycles** ($x\succ y,y\succ z, z\succ x$). 

Satisfying the WARP condition however, can resulting in violating transitivity in a 3 goods, 3 market scenarios (and more) situations. WARP is not a sufficient condition for revealed preferences to be the optimal choice as there is no universal preference.

#### Weak WARP
Only one choice reversal between subsets are allowed under weak WARP. WARP allows no choice reversals.
Assume $\{x,y\}\subseteq S\subseteq T$
$c(x,y)=x$
$c(S)=y$ here a choice reversal has occurred
By weak WARP, there is no further choice reversal allowed. Therefore,
$c(T)\ne x$

Formally, for all $x,y\in X$ and $S,T\in \chi$
$$\{x,y\}\subseteq S\subseteq T,x=c(xy)=c(T)\implies y\ne c(S)$$
