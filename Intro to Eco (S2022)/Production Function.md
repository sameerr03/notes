The slope of the function at a given point (holding all other inputs as constant) is the marginal product (additional output produced if input is increased by one unit).

The total output divided by a particular input is the average product

In a concave function, the marginal product reduces with an increase in input. This is callled [[Diminishing average product of labour]].

The set of all the possible events in a production function is withing the [[Feasable Frontier]]
