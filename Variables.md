**Discrete** variables can take only fixed values on the number line and not numbers in between.

**Continuous** variables can have any value on the number line

**Categorical** data does not rely on numbers to depict the information. However, it is still 
represented as numbers in the data set (converted by a numerical key)

**Nominal** does not compare the catagories

Ordinal sets **order** uses the numerical key of the catagory to give an idea of the order of the catagories. (universally relevant)

Ordinal sets **rank** uses the numerical key to give rank (relative order) to the particular catagory (relevant to only the group being ranked)
