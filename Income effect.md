<!--SR:!2022-10-15,3,268-->
There is no change in prices or [[opportunity cost]]. The feasable frontier expands, allowing for a point on a higher [[indifference curves]] where MRS=MRT is optimum. 

The line joining optimum points when income is increased is the :: income offer curve.

The income offer curve is in the x1 - x2 plane.

Engel curve is the graph of :: m on the y axis x on the x axis
<!--SR:!2022-10-17,4,272-->
The engel curve formula is all points that satisfy :: $$\hat{x}_1(p_1,p_2,m),m$$
