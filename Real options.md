The problem with the [[Firm's investment decisions#Future and present values Net present value NPV estimation|NPV]] method of valuing capital budgeting projects is that it ignores adjustments that firms can make after a project is accepted. These adjustments are called real options. The NPV as a result underestimates the true value of the project. 

Types of real options:
- Option to expand - Has value if the demand of the good turns out to be higher than projected
- Option to abandon - Has value if demand turns out to be lower than expected
- Option to Delay - Has value if the underlying variables are changing with a favorable trend - Delaying a project into the future results in a higher NPV after accounting for time value of money.

The market value of a project is the sum of NPV without options and the value of the managerial options implicit in the project $$\text M=\text{NPV}+\text{Options}$$
