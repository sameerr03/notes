A normal form game is a [[Game Theory|game]] where when players choose their stratergies, they are unaware of the actions of the other players (simultaneous move game). A normal form game is represented by
$$\Gamma=\{N,\ (S_i)_{i\in N},\ (u_i)_{i\in N}\}$$
Where:
- $N$ is the finite set of players
- $S_i$ is the set of moves for every $i$ in $N$. Conversely, $S_{-i}$ is the stratergy of all players other than $i$. (cartesian product of stratergies of all other players)
- $u_i$ is the utility function for each outcome. The domain of this function is the cartesian product of $(S_i)_{i\in N}$
