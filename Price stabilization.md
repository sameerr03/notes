The policy of maintaining prices in each time period in the [[Inflation model]].$$p_t=p_{t+1}=\text{.....}=p$$from [[simple model of money#Price level]] we know that this must mean that$$\frac 1{v_{t}}=\frac 1{v_{t+1}}=\text{.........}=\frac 1{v_t}$$This means that $$\frac{v_{t+2}}{v_{t+1}}=1$$At the SME we know that $(v_{t+1})/{v_{t}}=z/n$
this implies that in order for the prices to remain stable over time, $z=n$, or the growth rate of money supply = growth rate of population

This changes the budget constraint to$$c_1+c_2\le y+a$$ as $z/n=1$. Comparing this with the feasibility set from the [[social planner solution]], there is a deviation from the optimal
