A vector space with addition, $(V,+)$ is an abelion [[Groups|group]]. It is important to note that an empty set cannot be a vector space as it will not have the additive identity.

$\vec v$ is a vector, $|\vec v|$ is a scaler that represents the length of the vector $\vec v$. 

$\hat v=\vec v/|\vec v|$ is a unit vector of length 1 in the direction of $\vec v$.

All vector spaces are defined over [[Field]]s. $$\mathbb F\times V\to V$$$$\lambda v\to \lambda\cdot v$$$\lambda v\in V$ implies closure
Multiplication by 1 = $1\cdot v=v$
Associativity: $(\lambda_1\lambda_2)v=\lambda_1(\lambda_2 v)$
Distributivity: $(\lambda_1+\lambda_2)v=\lambda_1v+\lambda_2v$

Thus all the axioms are satisfied.
