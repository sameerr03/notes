A variation of the [[Overlapping generation model]], where commodity money (money with actual intrinsic value such as gold coins) is used instead of fiat money like in the [[simple model of money]]

The population in this model is constant at $N$. 

1 unit of the commodity money has the intrinsic value $\tilde v$ which is fixed over time. 

For a person born in period $t$,
in time $t$:
$$c_{1,t}+v_tm^g_t\le y$$Where:
- $m_t^g$ is the demand for gold in nominal terms (grams of gold, etc)
- $v_t$ is the real value of the nominal gold - amount of $y$ that can be bought from one unit of $m^g_t$

in time $t+1$, (when old)
$$c_{2,t+1}\le v_{t+1}m^g_t$$
Putting this together, the LTBC is$$c_{1,t}+\frac{v_t}{v_{t+1}}c_{2,t+1}\le y$$
For this model, there are two possible equilibria
- All gold in the economy is used exclusively as money
- Some gold is used as money and the rest as a commodity - 1 commodity and 2 purposes.

#### Gold used exclusively as money
$$\text{Entire stock of gold}=M^g$$From the market clearing condition,$$N(y-c_1)=v_tM^g$$
At the SME, (since gold is fixed)
$$v_t=v=\frac{N(y-c_1)}{M^g}$$
For all the money to remain as gold instead of using it as commodity, the real value of gold $v>\tilde v$ (intrinsic value of gold). Using this relation in the market clearing condition,

$$M^g<\frac{N(y-c_1)}{\tilde v}$$This is the condition for the first type of equilibrium
#### Gold used as both money and commodity
$$M^g=\text{Entire stock of gold}$$$${M^g}^*=\text{Stock of gold used as money}$$
$$M^g-{M^g}^*=\text{gold used as commodity (intrinsic value)}$$
From the market clearing condition$$v_t{M^g}^*=N(y-c_1)$$at SME,$$v_t=v=\frac{N(y-c_1)}{{M^g}^*}$$if $v<\tilde v$, value of gold as money < value of gold as commodity. Because of this, more gold is converted from the total $M^g$ (At zero cost). As a result, ${M^g}^*$ shrinks. Because of the reduction in the money supply, the value of nominal gold increases, therefore $v$ increases. 

This continues until $v=\tilde v$ and equilibrium is established. 

Under this condition, from the market clearing condition$$\frac{N(y-c_1)}{{M^g}^*}=\tilde v$$$${M^g}^*=\frac{N(y-c_1)}{\tilde v}$$The amount of nominal gold used as money is less then the total amount of money, ${M^g}^*<M^g$
$$M^g>\frac{N(y-c_1)}{\tilde v}$$This is the condition under which the second type of equilibrium is established
