# Equillibrium under iterated elimination of weakly dominant stratergies

This [[Equilibrium]] is built on the same assumptions of the previous. A [[dominant stratergy#Weakly dominated stratergy|weakly dominated stratergy]] will never be chosen, which is the basis for elimination. However, IEWDS does not work as well as [[IESDS]] as different orders of elimination can lead to different outcomes. An example of this is the median voter theorem.
