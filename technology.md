Technology is a process that converts raw materials into output that can be sold by a [[firm]]
The production function as a result is determined by the technology. 

### Returns to scale
Based on the production function, the technology can have differing returns to increasing the amount of inputs.

- If $f(tx_1,tx_2)=tf(x_1,x_2)$, the technology has constant returns to scale
- If $f(tx_1,tx_2)<tf(x_1,x_2)$, the technology has diminishing returns to scale
- If $f(tx_1,tx_2)>tf(x_1,x_2)$, the technology has increasing returns to scale

### Types
There are 3 types of technology $(A)$
- Labour augmenting - Increases output of labour
- Capital augmenting - Increases output of capital
- Higgs neutral - increases the entire production function
