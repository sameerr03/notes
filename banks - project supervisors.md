Banks also serve as monitors for investments. for this model, we assume that there are a large number of entrepreneurs and a large number of investors that posses $k$ goods.

Each project requires $\mu k$ of investment . These projects are successful with a probability of $\frac 23$, and in this case, gives the investor the return $x\mu k$ goods. Thus, the rate of return on one unit invested is given by $$\text{RO1}=\frac{x\mu k}{\mu k}=x$$
Each project can fail with a probability of $\frac 13$. In the case of failure, the failure has to be verified, which costs $\theta$. 

##### Case 1: direct investment 
each investor divides their capital among $J$ projects. We assume that $J$ is a large number in order to apply the law of large numbers. The investment in each of these projects by the investor is given by $$\text{Amount invested per project}=\frac kJ$$The profit from each project to the investor is given by $$\mathbb{E}(\text{Profit})=\frac 23x\frac kJ+\frac 13(-\theta)$$$$=\frac23 \frac {xk}J-\frac \theta 3$$Therefore, the total earnings of the investor from the entire portfolio is $$\text{Total earnings}=\frac 23xk-\frac J3\theta$$
##### Case 2: Indirect investment
Investors give all capital $k$ to the bank, which invests it in the projects. The profit from each project (for all the investors combined) is given by $$\mathbb{E}(\text{Profit from each project})=\frac 23\frac xk\mu k-\frac13\theta$$As each project requires $\mu k$ of investment, $\mu$ investors have to invest $k$ each into the bank for each project to be funded. Thus, $$\text{Earnings for each investor per project}=(\frac 23\frac xk\mu k-\frac13\theta)/\mu$$$$=\frac 23x-\frac 13\frac\theta\mu$$
##### Comparison of both cases
Comparing the earnings in both cases $$\frac 23x-\frac 13\frac\theta\mu>\frac 23xk-\frac J3\theta$$As $J$ is a large number, the cost of verification for failed projects are much higher in case 1. 

In case 2, the burden of verification is not on the individual investor, banks distribute the costs of verification over all the investors. As a result there is no duplication of efforts, leading to less downside to a failed project.
