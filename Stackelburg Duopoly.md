2 firms set quantities of production. Unlike [[Cournot competition]], this game is [[extensive form games|sequential]]. 

$I={1,2}$
$S_1=q_1\in[0,\infty)$
$S_2=q_2\in[0,\infty)$
$p=12-q_1-q_2$

Player 1 moves first. As there is an infinite amount of moves, there are infinite [[Nash equilibrium#Sub game perfect Nash Equillibrium|sub games]]. By sequential rationality, firm 2 chooses $q_2$ optimally. $q_1$ predicts this and plays according to what 2 does (backward induction).

Therefore for every $q_1$, firm 2 maximises profit $\pi_2$.$$\frac{\partial\pi_2}{\partial q_2}=\frac{\partial pq_2}{\partial q_2}=0$$$$\frac{\partial[12q_2-q_1q_2-q_2^2]}{\partial q_2}=12-q_1-2q_2=0$$$$q_2=\frac{12-q_1}{2}$$Reducing the game,

Firm 1 will predict this, and optimise according to this stratergy. Therefore, optimising for profit,
$$\frac{\partial \pi_1}{\partial q_1}=\partial[12q_1-q_1^2-\frac{12q_1-q_1^2}2]/\partial q_1=0$$$$=\partial[6q_1-\frac{q_1^2}2]/\partial q_1=6-q_1=0$$$$q_1=6$$From this, the SPNE is $$SPNE=(q_1^*=6,\frac{12-q_1}2)$$
Written like this as SPNE is a strategic profile, and 2 plays the stratergy given by the function. The outcome is $$SPNE_o=(6,3)$$
