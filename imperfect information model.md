Firms have imperfect or inadequate information about the price of products set by competing firms. As a result they misinterpret the relative price of their own good, leading to over or under production. (EP is misleading) 

These cause frictions in the economy which lead to the [[aggregate supply]] curve equation  
$$Y= \bar{Y}+\alpha(P- EP)$$
