$X$ is a random variable following a lognormal distribution. This means that $$Z=\ln X\sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$$This implies that $Z=\ln X$ and $Z$ is normally distributed. $e^Z=X$. The PDF of the normal distribution is given by $$f(z)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\exp(-\frac{(z-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2})$$The mean (expected value ) is given by taking the value times its probability and summing it up. However, PDF is continuous so we use an integral. Similar for the variance$$\mu_N=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}zf(z)dz, \ \sigma^2_N=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}(z-\mu_N)^2f(z)dz$$For the lognormal distribution however, $$\mu_{LN}=\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^zf(z)dz, \ \sigma_{LN}^2=\int_{-\infty}^\infty(e^z-\mu_{LN})^2f(z)dz$$
In terms of the normal distribution params, we can say that $$\mu_{LN}\approx \exp(\mu_N+0.5\sigma^2_N), \ \sigma^2_{LN}=\exp(2\mu_N+\sigma_N^2)\cdot(\exp(\sigma^2_N)-1)$$
