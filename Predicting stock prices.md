Let $P_0$ be the stock price at time $t=0$, and $P_T$ be the stock price at time $t=T$. We assume that the daily returns of a stock are independent [[Frequency distributions#Normal distributions|normally distributed]] [[random variables]]. $$r\sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$$The overall return of the stock from $t=0$ to $t=T$ is given by $$\frac{P_T}{P_0}=\frac{P_1}{P_0}\cdot\frac{P_2}{P_1}\dots\cdot\frac{P_T}{P_{T-1}}$$Taking logs on both sides to turn multiplication into additive terms, $$\ln (\frac{P_T}{P_0})=\ln(\frac{P_1}{P_0}\cdot\frac{P_2}{P_1}\dots\cdot\frac{P_T}{P_{T-1}})$$$$\ln(\frac{P_T}{P_0})=\ln(\frac{P_1}{P_0})+\ln(\frac{P_2}{P_1})+\dots+\ln(\frac{P_T}{P_{T-1}})$$We assume discrete time intervals between each time period $\Delta t=t_1-t_0=t_2-t_1=\dots$
We assume that in this time interval, the stock price undergoes [[Future and present values#Future value|continuous compounding]] at the rate of return determined by the random variable $r$. Therefore, we can represent the return as $$\ln(\frac{P_T}{P_0})=\ln(\frac{P_0\cdot e^{r_1\Delta t}}{P_0})+\ln(\frac{P_1\cdot e^{r_1\Delta t}}{P_1})+\dots+\ln(\frac{P_{T-1}\cdot e^{r_1\Delta t}}{P_{T-1}})$$$$\ln(\frac{P_T}{P_0})=r_1\Delta t+r_2\Delta t+\dots+r_{T-1}\Delta t$$$$P_T=P_0\cdot e^{(r_1+r_2+\dots+r_{T-1})\Delta t}\tag 1$$Suppose $r^*=r_1+r_2+\dots+r_{T-1}$, then it must also be randomly distributed by $$r^*=\sum_{i=1}^{T}r_i\sim N(\mu T, \sigma^2T)$$Therefore we get the equation for the evolution of the stock price as $$P_T=P_0\cdot e^{r^*\Delta t}$$$P_T$ here is going to have a [[Lognormal distribution]]. The mean and the variance of this distribution can be roughly estimated from the parameters of the return distribution as $$\hat \mu\approx e^{\mu T+0.5\sigma^2T},\ \hat\sigma^2\approx e^{2\mu T+\sigma^2 T}(e^{\sigma^2T}-1)$$We can also generate returns by sampling from a parameterized normal distribution and use equation (1) to find a stock price path. By taking many such vectors of returns, we can understand the distribution of the stock price using numerical simulation (Monte Carlo method).

 Using a simpler method of stock price evolution that does not use continuous compounding, $$P_n=P_0\prod_{i=1}^n(1+r_i)$$we can get the stock price path![[Pasted image 20240925185341.png]]
 And thus find the probability distribution of stock price at time $t=T$![[Pasted image 20240925185425.png]]
