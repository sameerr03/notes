According to Eugene Fama, the best model that describes the price of a stock is the [[Random walk process]]. In this process, $$p_t=p_{t-1}+e_t$$where $e_t$ is the shock/error term and is a [[white noise processes|white noise process]]. If a stock price follows the process $$p_t=\alpha+p_{t-1}+e_t$$then this is a random walk with drift. Both these processes are [[non-stationary series]].

The stock prices follow Random walks as markets are efficient when it comes to information. This means that the stock's current price is the reflection of all information that is currently available to traders and investors. This information has been used efficiently, resulting in all information arbitrage opportunities reducing to zero. 

From the initial stock price, $p_0$, we know that $$p_1=p_0+e_1$$Extrapolating, $$p_t=p_0+\sum_{t=1}^Te_t$$which is the time path of the stock price (without drift)

#### Forms of efficiency
- **Weak form:** Past prices (history of stock prices), trading volume are priced into the stocks current price
- **Semi - Strong form:** Company fundamentals, New product lines, Balance sheet, and management practices are priced into the stocks current price - publicly available information
- **Strong form:** Weak + Semi-strong + other important information available to investors that are public and private.

#### Behavioral challenges to market efficiency
Investors are not always rational - Fail to diversify, trade too much, seem to maximize taxes. 

This leads to a number of behavioral biases:
- Overconfidence
- Disposition Effect - Investors tend to hold on to assets to assets that have decreased in value and sell assets that increase in value
- Familiarity - Seek local and known opportunities more
- Representativeness - Overreaction based on a small sample or recent performance
- Conservatism - Underreaction (People are slow in adjusting their beliefs to new information)
- Risk Taking - Take big risks after a win or reduce risk level after a loss

#### Implications of market efficiency
- Investors should only expect to obtain a normal rate of return
- Firms should expect to receive the fair value for the securities that they sell
- Financial managers cannot time issues of new stocks and bonds, market anticipates it and there is a drop in price
- Price of a company's stock cannot be affected by a change in accounting
