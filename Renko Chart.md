A renko chart is a type of chart that tracks the price of an asset using only a standardized price measure, rather than both standardized price and time measures as seen in either line or candlestick charts. 

A renko chart smooths out the price of the asset and removes all the noise. Each brick is stacked 45 degrees to the previous one. A brick size needs to be set, can any amount or based on the [[Average true range (ATR)]]. The price needs to change by the brick size for a new brick to be formed in the trend direction. The price needs to change by twice the brick size in order to form a brick in the opposite trend direction.
