## Government purchases multiplier
The government purchases multiplier is the  :: change in income with a unit change in [[Keynesian cross|government spending]].
<!--SR:!2022-11-17,22,290-->
$$Y=C_1(Y-\bar{TX})+\bar{I}+G+C_0$$$$\frac{dY}{dG}=\frac{1}{1-C_1}$$
=>dY/dG::$$\frac{dY}{dG}=\frac{1}{1-MPC}$$
<!--SR:!2022-11-16,21,290-->

The multiplier is greater than 1 as 0>[[consumption function|MPC]]>1. Change in 1 unit of G results in an increase in Y greater than 1
## Tax multiplier
The tax multiplier is the :: change in income with a unit change in taxes.
<!--SR:!2022-11-21,26,290-->
$$Y=C_1(Y-TX)+\bar{I}+\bar{G}+C_0$$$$\frac{dY}{dTX}=\frac{-C_1}{1-C_1}$$
=>dY/dTX::$$\frac{dY}{dTX}=\frac{-MPC}{1-MPC}$$
<!--SR:!2022-11-14,19,250-->
With an increase in taxes, Y decreases. Amount depends on MPC
