Sample groups are a subset of the [[Population]] that fairly represent the population of interest such that inferences can be made about the entire population based on experiments/observations about the sample group. 
Good samples are [[randomness|random]] in the target population.

## Sampling error
Bad sample (not representative of population) -> skewed inferences about population of interest.

Errors can also be due to a lack of responses from certain groups of people in a survey or an interviewer inflicting bias (non-sampling error).
