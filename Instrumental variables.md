In the case of a [[Simple Linear Regression]],$$y_i=\alpha+\beta\text{Treat}+u_i$$there is concern that the Treat variable is correlated with the error term. An instrumental variable $Z$ can be found that causally affects the treat variable which affects $y$, but the instrumental variable does not affect $y$ directly. As $Z$ does not directly affect $y$ it cannot be correlated with the error term. This can be used to find another regression that can be used to explain the same result.$$\text{1-  }X=a+bZ+e$$$$\text{2-  }y=\alpha+\beta X+u$$
the first regression is used to give predictive values on the second.
