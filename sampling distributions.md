### Chi square distributon

taking the number of Normal RVs X (k) and squaring and adding, when k is higher, the distribution resembles a normal distribution (but slightly skewed). This is the $\chi^2$ distribution. k is the **degrees of freedom**

### T-distribution

$$t=\frac{Z_1}{\sqrt{Z_2/k}}$$
where:
- $Z_1$ is a standar normal distribution
- $Z_2$ is a $\chi^2$ distribution with k degrees of freedom

### F-distribution

$$F=\frac{Z_1/k}{Z_2/k}$$
Ratio of two $\chi^2$ distributions. Can be used for comparing standard deviations.
