A centralized social planner collects all the perishable goods and distributes it in order to maximize utility. $$\text{Total Consumption}=N_{t-1}c_{2,t}+N_tc_{1,t}$$$$\text{Total Endowment}=N_ty$$Therefore,$$N_{t-1}c_{2,t}+N_tc_{1,t}\le N_ty$$Dividing both sides by $N_t$,$$c_{1,t}+\frac{N_{t-1}}{N_t}c_{2,t}\le y$$$$c_{1,t}+\frac{N_{t-1}}{nN_{t-1}}c_{2,t}\le y$$$$c_{1,t}+\frac1nc_{2,t}\le y$$The solution is stationary across all time periods as the allocation is independent of time related factors. Therefore the feasability set is $$c_1+\frac1nc_2\le y$$Plotting this set,

As $n$ falls, $ny$ falls leading to an increase in the slope (slope is negative).

Overlapping this with indifference curves,

This is the optimal social planner solution. However it is not an ideal system as power is concentrated, social planning has to occur at no cost for maximum resource usage.
