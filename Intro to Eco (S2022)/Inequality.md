### Gini Coefficient
Measure of inequality, calculated by the deviation of the Lorentz curve from the perfect equality line. It is calculated by finding the ratio of the area of the lorentz curve and the perfect equality line to the area of the triangle formed by the perfect equality line and the axes.
