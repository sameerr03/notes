A [[firm]] that allows individuals to [[consumption smoothing|consumption smooth]] over time is an [[Insurance]] firm. The policy holder pays a premium to the insurance company, which protects them in the case of certain pre-defined risks. While in case the risks happen, the firm looses money on that particular policy, by the [[point estimation|law of large numbers]], it still makes a profit as not every policy holder is going to experience the risk. 

If $p$ is the probability of a claim, then the [[Risk]] or standard deviation against $n$ policy holders is given by $$\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}n}$$As $n$ increases the standard deviation falls to a negligable value. However, this can be violated due to two circumstances:
- Moral Hazards: An already insured person is likely to be more reckless given that they know that they are insured. This results in the probabilities of those being insured being skewed, resulting in the violation of the law of large numbers. 
- Selection Bias: Selection bias can result in skewed claims. Medical insurance attracts sick people therefore if these people are not screened before being given a contract, the sample is not random resuting in the risk not falling.

Insurance can have informational value. Rising insurance premiums for fire insurance in a fire prone area are a sign of how prone the area is to fire. This can warn buyers of the house in that area.

Insurance guarantee funds set up by the government protect the policy holder in case the insurance company itself goes under.
