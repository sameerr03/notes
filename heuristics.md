Heuristics are simple rules of thumb or mental shortcuts that people use to arrive at judgements and decisions. heuristics are fast and frugal (work with limited information)

Kahneman and Tversky -> heuristics can lead to systemic bias

### Heuristics
#### Representativeness heuristic
People can believe that departure from average behavior can correct to the population mean in the short run due to representativeness heuristic. (Eg: Tossing a coin and repeatedly getting Hs might expect a T (More representative about flipping of a coin) although each event is independent).

This can result in 2 fallacies:
- Gambler's fallacy - There exists negative autocorrelation in an inherently independent random process (expects a poor outcome after a winstreak)
- Hot-Hands fallacy - There exists positive autocorrelation in an inherently independent random process (expects basketball player to keep making 3 pointers after a good streak)

#### Availability heuristic
Situations where people asses the frequency of a class of events based on how available the information is. (Strokes judged to be 1:5 times as accidents but in actuality 2:1)

#### Affect heuristic
Relying on emotions rather than concrete information to make decision

#### Anchoring heuristic
Inferences made by people are heavily dependent on an initial suggestion or anchor (adding information to base around responses (engineer salary example))

### Effects
#### Framing effects
Formulation of a problem has an influence on the responses. (different questions presented to people can change their answers).
