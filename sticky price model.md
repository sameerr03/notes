# Sticky price model

## Reasons behind prices being sluggish/sticky
 - Menu cost hypothesis → there are costs associated with changing nominal prices. Therefore it is not optimal to change P for the firm.
 - loss of consumer goodwill → with increased competition, consumers may move to other firms due to a rise in nominal price
- Price wars - price cutting on a change in demand may trigger price wars between competing firms
- Collusion - firms collude and set high prices (highly regulated)
- wages are not flexible in the short run (contracts). Therefore prices do not adjust.
- Efficiency wage theory- best interest in the firm to pay higher real wages.
	- labor turnover is costly
	- training workers is costly
	- reduces workers shirking on their job.
- if prices increase- firms need to increase price as intermediate goods become more expensive.


## Derivation of AS equation from the notion of sticky prices

if prices increase, [[firm]]s need to increase price as intermediate goods become more expensive.

When demand in the economy is high $(Y>\bar{Y})$. in the short run, firms can only increase labour    -> MPL falls ([[Diminishing average product of labour]]) -> Marginal cost from increasing labour increases -> prices increase. 

Certain firms prefer to keep a fixed prices. As a result, predicted prices are used. For these firms,$$p=EP+a(EY-\bar{EY})$$ Out of all the firms in the economy, $s$ proportion of all firms set sticky prices. The remaining $1-s$ firms have flexible prices. The price of the economy is determined by the aggregate of all the prices of producers. The aggregate of sticky firms are $$sp=sEP+sa(EY-\bar{EY})$$$EY-\bar{EY}$ is zero as we assume that the firms are rational and assume that the current emplyment is and will be the natural employment rate.The aggregate of non sticky firms is $$(1-s)p=(1-s)P+(1-s)a(Y-\bar{Y})$$
Therefore the aggregate for the economy will be $$sp+p-sp=sEP+(1-s)P+(1-s)s(Y-\bar{Y})$$
This is simplified into $$P=EP+\frac{a(1-s)}{s}(Y-\bar{Y})$$p becomes P as when we add the prices for all the firms we get that aggregate prices in the economy. Representing it in terms of Y, we get $$Y=\bar{Y}+\alpha(P-EP)$$which is the [[aggregate supply]] equation. Two kinds of price setters are behind this expression
