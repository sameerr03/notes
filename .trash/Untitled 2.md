# Marginal propensity to consume (MPC)
Marginal propensity to consume is the fraction of an individuals income that is used in consumption. In lower income countries, MPC is higher as the overall income is lower so more has to be spent on consumption. In higher income countries, average mpc is much lower as overall income is much higher

$$MPC = f(x) = \frac{x^{2}}{x+AD}$$
