# Heading
This is a test of a system where I type on my tab. This method is a bit loppy and less comfortable,  but feels faster when it comes to typing but is slower when it comes to drawing diagrams. This method allows me to link notes immediately while allowing me to go back and update and edit older notes which is quite useful. 

## Sub heading
This method requires less work after class if I take down with optimum efficiency. More prone to mistakes tho which can be bad. It is better to write down and covert to obsidian later I think [[Write]] is the superior method for new information whereas I will use this for editing old notes.
