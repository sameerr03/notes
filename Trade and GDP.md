There is a correlation between trade openness and GDP per capita. There are two possibilities of this. Considering a generic production function, $$Y=Af(K)$$The possibilities are that
- $A$ increases with more trade 
- $f(K)$ increases with more trade

If $$y=Ak^\alpha$$then the $$MPK=\alpha Ak^{\alpha-1}=r$$This is obtained from profit maximisation
$$k=(\frac{\alpha A}{r})^{1/(1-\alpha)}$$The higher $A$ is, the higher $k$ is. As $r$ goes up, lower $k$. There is no dependance on the savings rate, unlike in the solow model. However, solow is imperically more accurate, as domestic investment is carried out with domestic savings and not by foreign actors. Therefore, trade must boost the productivity of $k$ and not $A$. 

Trade makes a country more productive. 
- It can produce the things it has a relative advantage in (Ricardian gains from trade)
- Trade allows for inputs and tech from abroad to be used in production
- Weakens the monopolistic power of firms
- Allows firms to take advantage of lower average costs with increased production by exporting the surplus
- Resources are transfered from less productive firms which are driven out of business to more competitive firms
