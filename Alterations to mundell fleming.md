### [[Mundell fleming model|Small open economy]] with fixed [[Exchange rates]]

the central bank plays an active role in keeping E constant. When there is a demand increase for domestic money, supply is shifted outwards by selling foreign reserves to buy domestic currency and put the money into the domestic economy, increasing the money supply

On the contrary, the Central [[bank]] can reduce supply of domestic currency by buying foreign currency and selling domestic currency

Essentialy, expansionary or contractionary monetary policy is used to keep exchange rates constant. 

#### [[Fiscal Policy]]

![[Pasted image 20221126030828.png|400]]
An increase in G -> Y increases -> Money demand increase -> r above r* -> demand for domestic currency increases -> More domestic currency in the economy, Money supply increases -> r falls back to r*

Exchange rate increase offset by monetary policy, resulting in higher Y with the same exchange rate. 

#### [[Monetary policy]]

As the exchnage rate is fixed, monetary policy is ineffective as it directly alters the exchnage rates.

### Large open economy
In a large open economy, there is no fixed world interest rate level for the economy to have. The goods market equation changes because of the inclusion of [[Capital flow]] to$$Y=C(Y-T)+I(r)+G+CF(r)$$
At the same time, as r is not fixed, the LM is not a straight line anymore. The [[ISLM model|ISLM]] setup becomes 
![[Pasted image 20221220201553.png|500]]
Through the capital flows curve, the equilibrium [[Exchange rates|exchange rate]] is obtained in the large open economy. in a large open economy, Y changes through I and CF. As a result, if r reduces, Y increases by a greater margin as both [[investment]] and capital flows increaese. This is seen in the slope becoming flatter as compared to the IS of a closed economy, Y is more sensitive to r. 

#### Fiscal Policy
![[Pasted image 20221220202205.png|500]]
The IS shifts out through an increase in G. However, the interest rate increases, leading to a fall in the the capital flows, leading to a fall in net exports and an increase in the exchange rates. Y and r both increase, but to a lesser extent as the crowding out effect is more powerfull due to a fall in investment **and** a fall in net exports.$$\Delta Y=\Delta G -\Delta I-\Delta NX$$
Compared to a closed economy, fiscal policy is less effective as the crowding out is only due to one factor there. Closed>Large open>Small open (floating E)

#### Monetary policy
![[Pasted image 20221220203045.png|500]]
When money supply increases, interest rate decreases, leading to an increase in investment and net exports through capital flows. The equillibrium exchnage rate falls. Y increases by an increase in both I and NX (2 factors). As a result monetary policy becomes more effective compared to a closed economy (1 factor- investment).

Large open>small open(floating E)~Closed economy

Small open happens due to change in NX, closed happens to change in I so the overall effectiveness depends on the slopes of the functions.
