The phillips curve :: plots [[inflation]] rate to unemployment. 
<!--SR:!2022-11-20,20,299-->
The phillips curve eqation is :: $$\pi= E\pi - \beta (u- u^n ) + \mu$$
Where:
<!--SR:!2022-11-02,2,259-->
- $\pi$ is the inflation, $E\pi$ is the expected inflation
- $u$ is the unemployment rate, $u^n$ is the natural (long run equillibrium) unemployment rate and $u-u^n$  is the cyclical unemployment in the economy.
- $\mu$ is the supply shocks

There is only one unemployment rate at which inflation is stable (inflation-stabilizing rate). 

## Derivation from [[aggregate supply]]
$$Y = \bar{ Y}+\alpha ( P- EP )+\mu$$
$$P= EP+\frac{ 1}{\alpha}(Y- \bar{Y}) + \mu$$
Subtracting price in time t= -1 (previous time period)
$$P - P_{-1} = EP - P_{-1} + \frac{ 1 }{\alpha}(Y-\bar{Y}) +\mu$$
$$\pi= E\pi + \frac {1}{\alpha}(Y-\bar{Y})+ \mu$$
Substituting with [[Okun's law]],
$$\pi= E\pi -\beta(u-u^n)+ \mu$$

## Shifts in the curve

RED: By increasing expectations of inflation, or a positive supply shock will result in:: the phillips curve shifting outwards. The same unemployment rate has higher rates of interest associated with it.

## Sacrifice ratio
Sacrifice ratio :: How much of a decrease in GDP to reduce inflation by 1%.
<!--SR:!2022-11-19,24,290-->

$$u-u^n=\frac{\mu+1}{\beta}$$
can also be written as the ratio of change in output to the chnage in inflation.

## [[bargaining gap]] and inflation
positive bargaining gap in boom -> inflation
negative bargaining gap in recession -> deflation
