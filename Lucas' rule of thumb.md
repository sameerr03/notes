A country growing at $g$ percent per annum will double its per capita income every $\frac{70}{g}$ years.

### Derivation
Time goes from time $t=0$ to $t=t$. In this time the per capita [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] will double $Y_t=2Y_0$. If the growth rate is $g$, the growth of the country will be given by$$Y_t=Y_0e^{gt}$$$$gt=\ln{(\frac{Y_t}{Y_0})}$$$$t=\frac{\ln2}{g}$$
