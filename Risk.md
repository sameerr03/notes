Risk is inherant to investing. Any form of investing has risk associated with it. Therefore it is necessary to diversify investment portfolios. It is an alternative to [[Insurance (finance)]]. Risk to an asset becomes irrelevant, the risk (variance) to the whole portfolio is necessary. However, each asset contributes to the risk to the entire portfolio, not just by itself but also including [[Stock Covariance]].

### Risk to a stock
#### Systematic Risk
The risk in an investment in a stock based on the risk to the entire market. A fear of the stock price of an investment in reaction to the overall market. A high [[Stock corellation|beta]] stock overreacts resulting in greater losses during a market low period.

This risk is obtained from the fluctuations (variance) in the market
$$var(R)=\beta^2var(M)+var(u)$$Where:
- R is the return on the stock
- M is the return on the market
- u is the residual

Stocks can be high beta if the firm invests in risky or expensive projects with uncertain returns, or if the firm borrows a lot of money demanding high returns or low returns. In a portfolio, having negative beta stocks can result in offsetting market shocks, as a sort of [[Insurance (finance)]].
#### Idiosyncratic risk
These are risks not related to the market but rather the stock itself. A firm producing a bad product that drives share price down.

This risk forms the residual term of the [[Stock corellation]].

### Risk to a [[portfolio]]
#### Stock [[Jointly distributed random variables#Covariance|covariance]]
Stocks that are independant to each other pose less risk to the investor. This is because correlated stocks can result in either huge gains or losses (high positive covariance) or in no gain (high negative covariance). 

The covariances are calculated by finding the [[Return Distributions]] of the stocks and the reasons behind their success/faliure in order to determine the probability of particular outcomes across multiple stocks, which can be used to determine the covariance across a portfolio.
