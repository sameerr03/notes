# Balance Sheets
A record of the [[Assets and Liabilities |assets, liabilities]] and the [[wealth]](net worth) of an economic actor.

The Balace sheet identitiy states that:
assets = liabilities + net worth

loans do not affect net worth as the liability of the debt and principal owed is equal to the asset gained in the loan.


## For a [[firm]]

A balance sheet conveys the "book value" of a company. It gives an investor an idea of the assets, liabilities and the owner's equity in the firm (what a firm owns, owes and the amount invested by the owners/shareholders). The accounting equation is used to understand the capital structure and the rates of return of a company $$Assets=Liabilities \ +\ Owner's\ Equity$$
Assets are anything owned by the company with a quantifiable value (resale), liabilities are the money owed to debtors, rent and utility payments, [[Bond Valuation|bond]] payments and taxes. owners equity is essentially the net worth of the company - amount of all the money if the assets are sold and liabilities are paid off which is the money that belongs to the shareholders of a company which can be either private or public investors. 

**Current assets** are any assets that a company expects to convert into cash within an upcoming year. Examples of such assets are:
- Cash and cash equivalents
- Inventory
- Accounts receivable

**Noncurrent Assets** are assets that cannot be converted into cash in the short term, such as 
- Land
- Patents
- Brands
- Equipment

Current and noncurrent liabilities work in very much the same way. Current liabilities are:
- payroll expenses
- Accounts payable
- rent
- utility

noncurrent liabilities are:
- loans
- bond provisions
- pension provisions

The owner's equity typically includes 2 key elements : money contributed to the business in the form of investment in exchange for some degree of ownership. The second is earnings that the company generates over the past and retains. 

Working Capital = Current Assets - Liabilities
