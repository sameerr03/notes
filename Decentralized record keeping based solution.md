A young person in period $t$ gives $\phi_t$ goods for all the old people. This person, in the next time period when old receives $\phi_{t+1}^R$ goods whenever. $$\phi^R_{t+1}=x_{t+1}\phi_t$$where $x_{t+1}$ is market determined. Those who deviate are excluded from this system. For an agent born in period $t$, the [[Budget sets|budget constraint]] is$$c_{1,t}+\phi_t\le y$$In the next time period, the same agent has the constraint$$c_{2,t+1}\le \phi_{t+1}^R$$$$c_{2,t+1}\le x_{t+1}\phi_{t}$$$$\frac{c_{2,t+1}}{x_{t+1}}\le\phi_t$$It is irrational to consume less than the endowment in each period. Therefore the equations are equalities and not inequalities. Using the constraints from both periods,$$c_{1,t}+\frac{c_{2,t+1}}{x_{t+1}}=y$$As the optimization is time independent, the solution is stationary. This gives the intertemporal budget constraint.$$c_1+\frac1xc_2=y$$
### finding the value of $x$
In period $t+1$,
$N_{t+1}$ young people who each contribute $y-c_1$
Since the old people consume what the young contribute, the total for consumption for old people is $N_{t+1}(y-c_1)$
Amount received by each old person in period $t+1$ is$$\phi_{t+1}^R=\frac{N_{t+1}(y-c_1)}{N_t}$$$$=n(y-c_1)$$
In period $t$ contributions made by the young are given by $\phi_t=y-c$
We know that $x$ is given by $\phi^R_{t+1}=x_{t+1}\phi_t$. Therefore,$$x=\frac{\phi^R}{\phi}=\frac{n(y-c_1)}{y-c_1}=n$$Optimizing with utility curves, we get

This is the same result as in the [[social planner solution]], however this system is constrainted by cheap record keeping. If it does not exist, consumption is not [[pareto efficient]] due to the cost or the enforcement of punishment of deviation will not be effective.
