when the prizes of a [[Lotteries|lottery]] are monetary, the [[Utility function]] is strictly monotone and strictly increasing (more money = more utility)

Plotting a [[vNm Expected utility|vNM function]] can be used to describe an individuals preference over lotteries, simple or compounded. 

A lottery with a fixed outcome (green), ie prize has a probability of 1, is on the vNM curve (with expected utility on the Y axis and prize value on the x). 

A simple lottery (red) is represented by the two outcomes, and a chord drawn between them. The convex combination according to the probabilities of the prizes is taken and the corresponding point on the chord is taken to be the expected utility of the lottery. 

For a complex lottery (purple), it is broken down into simple lotteries. A chord is drawn for one and more chords are drawn between the point of convex combination of a simple lottery that is a part of the system and the vNM curve. The convex combination of this new chord will give the expected utility of the complex lottery.
