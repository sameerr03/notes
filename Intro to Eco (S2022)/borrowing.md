# Borrowing
Borrowing allows us to buy more now, at the cost of buying less later.

The interest rate ($r$) is the power of bringing some purchasing power ([[money]]) forward in time

$(1+r)$ reflects the tradeoff between current and future consumption (MRT)

The persons [[indifference curves]] are determined based on their impatience and desire for [[consumption smoothing]]. The slope of these ICs (MRS) is obtained from the discount rate.

The individual borrows at the point where discount rate = interest rate or MRS = MRT
=> $1+\rho=1+r$
