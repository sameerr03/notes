The [[Present Value]] of the expected [[Cash flows]] of an asset. A DCF has three parts
- Cash Flows
- Discount Rate - reflects risk in the cash flows
- Lifetime of the asset

DCF valuation of a company is a metric of valuation where the company is given a value based on the present value of its future cash flows.

DCFs assume that markets make mistakes in valuing individual companies and these mistakes are corrected over times. 

DCF valuations are only corrected in a long time horizon. 

#### Basic propositions
- For a company to have values, it must have positive cash flows at some point in time. For a business that has negative cash flows, for it to have intrinsic value, it must have disproportionately large cash flows in the future

#### Technicals of a DCF
Two steps to set up a DCF
1. Get expected cash flows
2. Adjust for risk

A DCF can be set up in two ways
##### Expected cash flows
Get the expected cash flows in all scenarios of the asset. Discount rate adjusted for risk$$\text{Value of asset}=\frac{E(CF_1)}{(1+r)}+\frac{E(CF_2)}{(1+r)^2}+\frac{E(CF_3)}{(1+r)^3}...+\frac{E(CF_n)}{(1+r)^n}$$

##### Risk adjusted cash flows
Instead of using the discount rate to adjust for risk, the cash flows are adjusted for risk. This is done by finding the [[risk preference|certainty equivalent]] of the cash flow (Risky cash flow=Lower certain cash flow)
$$\text{Value of asset}=\frac{CE(CF_1)}{(1+r_f)}+\frac{CE(CF_2)}{(1+r_f)^2}+\frac{CE(CF_3)}{(1+r_f)^3}...+\frac{CE(CF_n)}{(1+r_f)^n}$$
Here, $r_f$ is the risk free rate of return, as the cash flows are already adjusted for risk through the certainty equivalent.
