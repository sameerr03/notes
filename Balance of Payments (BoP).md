**Balance of payments (BoP)** :: records of all transactions between economic actors and the rest of the world.

BoP = Current accounts + Capital accounts

Where:
- Current accounts :: Value of exports - value of Imports + net transfers from abroad (NRI transfers, etc)
- Capital account :: receipt on sale of domestic assets - spending on buying foreign assets**

Central [[bank]]s hold [[Foreign Trade|foreign currency]], which is used to finance BoP deficit:
- BoP surplus ⇒ more foreign currency → used to buy more domestic currency → increase [[Money market#Supply side|money supply]]
- BOP deficit ⇒ give up foreign currency → domestic converted into foreign currency → reduces money supply
