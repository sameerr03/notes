In a country that is labour intensive vs a country that is capital intensive (typically richer), capital biased technology lead to increases in $y$ only in the capital intensive country whereas no difference to a country that is labour intensive. A neutral technological improvement benefits both simultaneously. Using the incorrect form of technology is a potential contributer to the [[solow residual]] between two countries. Modifying the [[Technology Transfer]] production function,$$y=A(k|k')k^{1-\alpha}$$where $A(k|k')$ is the total factor productivity of the technology. Designed to be used with k' instead of k. If k is less than k', there is a loss in efficiency. $$A(k|k')=A\ min\{1,(\frac{k}{k'}^\gamma)\}$$In an economy with a lower worker to capital ratio, A is not as efficient. $$y=A(k|k')k^{1-\alpha}=Ak^{1-\alpha+\gamma}(k')^{-\gamma}$$This means that less developed countries are less productive than advanced countries even when they are using the same technology.
