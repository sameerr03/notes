A competition filter is used to model decisions made under the [[choice overload]] condition. A [[Consideration set]] mapping is a competition filter if for all $x\in S\subseteq T$,$$x\in\Gamma(T)\implies x\in\Gamma(S)$$Intuitively, this means that if an alternative receives consideration in a larger menu in the face of greater competition, then it receives consideration in a smaller menu where the competition is less.
