# Aggregate Demand (AD)
The aggregate demand ($AD$) = [[consumption function]] + [[investment]] + role of the government + [[Foreign Trade]]
$$AD=C_0+C_1(1-t)Y+I+G+X-mY$$

The aggregate demand shows the amount spent in an economy

The investment is assumed to be independant of the output ($Y$). The slope of the ($AD$) line is below 45$^\circ$ as MPC<1. The 45$^\circ$ line is where ($AD=Y$), which is called the goods-market [[Intro to Eco (S2022)/equillibrium]]. 

A steep slope implies no consumption smoothing as the consumption varies greatly with income, flat curve implies [[consumption smoothing]]

Savings, taxes and imports are leakages from the circular flow of income, and decrease the multiplier. 

## Paradox of thrift
Households worried about falling [[wealth]] cut spending and increase savings during a recession. In an aggregate attempt to increase savings, the aggregate income falls because of the reduction in aggregate demand and the multiplier effect.
