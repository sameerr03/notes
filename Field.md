A field ($\mathbb F$) is a [[Set theory|set]] with two binary operations, denoted as $(\mathbb F, +, .)$. A field satisfies the following axioms:
1. Closure of addition and multiplication: $\forall\  x,y\in \mathbb F, x+y\in \mathbb F, x.y\in \mathbb F$
2. Addition is commutative: $(x+y=y+x), \forall x,y\in \mathbb F$
3. Addition is associate: $(x+y)+z=x+(y+z),\forall\ x,y,z\in \mathbb F$
4. Existence of additive identity: $\exists\ 0\in \mathbb F$ such that $x+0=0+x=x,\ \forall\ x\in \mathbb F$
5. Existence of additive inverse: $\forall x\in \mathbb F,\ \exists\ y\in \mathbb F$ such that $x+y=y+x=0\ (y=-x)$
6. Multiplication is associative: $(xy)z=x(yz),\ \forall\ x,y,z\in \mathbb F$
7. Distributive property: $x(y+z)=xy+xz,\ \forall x, y, z\in \mathbb F$
8. Existence of a multiplicative inverse: $\forall\ x\in \mathbb F, x\ne 0, \exists\ y\in \mathbb F$ such that $x.y=1=y.x$ ($y=x^{-1}$)
9. Existence of multiplicative identity: $\exists\ 1\in \mathbb F$ such that $x.1=1.x=x, \forall\ x\in \mathbb F$ 

A field is a unital and commutative [[Rings|ring]] such that every nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse.
$\mathbb R, \mathbb Q, \mathbb C$ are fields
