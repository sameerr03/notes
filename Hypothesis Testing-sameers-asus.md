Make a precise hypothesis and test it instead of a range like in interval estimation

2 hypothesis are made, null and alternative
|Null|Alternative|
|---|---|
|Assumed to be given|Needs to be proven|
|Assumed based on the status quo/prior statistical evidence|Rejecion of the assumption|
|Must contain an equality =,$\le$,$\ge$|Must not contain an equality$\ne$,>,<|

The null and the alternative cannot be simultaneously true by design

The outcomes of hypothesis testing is either the rejection of the null hypothesis (alternative is valid) or the faliure to reject the null hypothesis (null is valid)

If the sample mean lies within the critical region (1-[[Estimation of population mean|confidence interval]]=$\alpha$), the hypothesis is rejected.
