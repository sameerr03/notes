In the event of an exogenous shock for the DM, their consumption in state of shock $c_1$ and consumption in state of no shock $c_2$ will differ. Based on the probability of the shock, their [[vNm Expected utility]] will be $$EU=\pi u(c_1)+(1-\pi)u(c_2)$$
For a standard monotone concave EU function, the ICs are

With general probabilites, the MRS equation is given by $$c_2'(c_1)=\frac{-\pi u'(c_1)}{(1-\pi)u'(c_2(c_1))}$$
and on the 45-degree line it is determined by the ratio of probabilites as $c_2(c_1)=c_1$
$$c_2'=\frac{-\pi}{(1-\pi)}$$
