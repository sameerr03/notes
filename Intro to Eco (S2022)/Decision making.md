# Decision making
In a constrained choice problem (one which results in finding the optimal choice based on preferences (a description of the benefit or cost associated with each possible outcome)), [[Utility]] maximization is done by overlaping the [[Feasable Frontier]] and the [[indifference curves]]. At the point where the MRS and the MRT are equal and the point lies on the feasable frontier, the utility is maximised. If MRS > MRT, the points the player is willing to trade off an extra hour of free time is greater than the [[opportunity cost]] of that hour (The player increases free time). If MRT > MRS, the grade points the player is willing to trade for an extra hour of free time is less than the opportunity cost of that extra hour of free time (The player decreases free time).
