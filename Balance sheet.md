An accountant's snapshot of the [[firm]]'s accounting value

The firms balance sheet is typically divided into three sections:
- Assets - What the firm owns (On the left)
- Liabilities - What the firm owes (On the right)
- Shareholder's equity - What the shareholder/ other types of firm owners have given to the firm

### Balance sheet identity
$$\text{Shareholder's Equity}=\text{Assets}-\text{Liabilities}$$
### Assets
According to time, there are two types of assets:
- Current assets - Short term assets (Less than 1 year). Eg - Inventory, accounts receivables 
- Non-current assets - Long term assets (more than 1 year). Eg - Long term money lent, buildings, machinery, etc.

According to characteristic, there are two further types of assets
- Tangible assets - Machinery, buildings and so on
- Intangible assets - Intellectual property, Branding

On the balance sheet, these are listed in the order of most to least liquid assets. It is also important to note that balance sheets only carry the historical cost of the asset (value at the time of purchase or gross value of the asset)

It is the [[Financial management]]'s responsibility to determine to determine what assets to invest in, both current and non current. 

#### Depreciation and Amortization
**Depreciation** is the loss of value in an asset due to usage - machine wear, etc. On a balance sheet, the value of the asset at time of purchase is given, less the accumulated depreciation since when the asset was purchased. Depreciation is practically unverifiable, therefore a pre-determined rate is determined by tax authorities that is applied. This rate can be straight line, implying that each year the depreciation is determined by the percentage of the initial value of the asset. 

**Amortization** is the loss of value in an intangible asset over time.

Both depreciation and amortization are accounting techniques to offset upfront expenses of the purchase of these assets. 

### Liabilities 
According to time, there are two types of liabilities:
- Current liabilities - Short term liabilities (Less than 1 year). Eg - accounts payable (got certain good on credit, not paid yet), short term loans 
- Non-current liabilities - Long term liabilities (more than 1 year). Eg - Long term loans 

On the balance sheet, the liabilities are listed in order of the time to maturity. 

**differed taxes** are included as noncurrent liabilities. These are taxes that are due this year, but postponed to a future date, beyond the 1-y current liability horizon. 
### Shareholder's equity
Money attributable to the owners of a business or its shareholders. In the case of a company listed on the stock exchange, this value is independent of the stock market value - as the market value does not go to the company - only when new shares are issued. Retained earnings, dividend payments are included in this category. 

Shareholders can finance the firm in two main ways:

| Debt | Equity |
| ---- | ---- |
| Money raised by issuing bonds | Money raised by issuing new shares of stock |
| Investors do not share in the risk of the business - Money is promised as long as the firm stays solvent | Investors share in the risk of the business - shares of the business can be delisted or go to 0 in case of firm issue |

There are two different kinds of equity,

| Preferred Stock | Common Stock |
| ---- | ---- |
| Dividend payment is prioritized to these shareholders. The dividend rate is a fixed predetermined rate (Behaves like a bond in this manner) | Dividends paid to shareholders after preffered stock holders |
| No voting rights | Common stock holders have voting rights |

Capital Surplus is another part of the shareholders equity - Represents all the profits from a company selling shares of their own or any other stock

Treasury Stock - Stock held by the company. This is subtracted from shareholder's equity

### Balance sheet analysis
#### Liquidity
Liquidity is the ease and quickness with which an asset can be converted into cash without a significant loss in value. The more liquid a firms assets, the more likely it will be able to pay its short term obligations. However, liquid assets typically have lower rates of returns than fixed assets, implying that too much liquidity is not a good sign due to the opportunity cost of cash. 

#### Debt vs Equity
Discusses how the company raises capital. Debt financing is cheaper, as the interest paid to bondholders is tax deductible. However, bondholders have the first claim to the companies cash flow. This makes it unfeasible to solely finance on debt.

#### Value vs Cost
Value represents market value, which fluctuates on a semi-arbitrary basis. Therefore it is very different from the historical cost. A cost perspective of a company could be based on the historical prices of all its assets less liabilities and shareholders equity. The value of the company is based on its market capitalization in the stock market.
