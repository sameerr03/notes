Suppose we have wealth $X_0$ at time 0, which is invested in a portfolio of $N$ stocks. The investment in each stock is given by the equation$$X_0=\sum_{i=1}^NX_{0i}$$This can alternatively be written in the form of weights$$X_0=\sum_{i=1}^Nw_iX_0$$where $$\sum_{i=1}^Nw_i=1$$Therefore, the one period return of the portfolio is given by $$R_\Pi=\frac{X_1}{X_0}-1=\frac{\sum X_{1i}-\sum X_{0i}}{\sum X_{0i}}$$If $r_{ti}$ is the return of security $i$ in time $t$, then the return of the portfolio$$R_\Pi=\frac{\sum X_{0i}(1+r_{1i})-\sum X_{0i}}{\sum X_{0i}}=\frac{\sum X_{0i}r_{1i}}{\sum X_{0i}}=\frac{\sum w_i r_{1i}X_0}{\sum w_iX_0}$$But $\sum w_iX_0=X_0$. Therefore, $$R_\Pi=\sum_{i=1}^Nw_ir_{ti}$$
