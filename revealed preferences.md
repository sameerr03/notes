# Revealed [[Choice sets#Preferences|preferences]]
Preferences that are revealed based on observations of and inferences from impirical data, not from the consumers directly (practical method of preference mapping rather than a purely theoretical one)

There are $J$ choices of $N$ goods at all income pairs ($\tilde{p}^J,m^J$). Each income pair represents a particular scenario in a market where the price of the goods and income is fixed. These change in different market scenarios. $\tilde{x}^J$ is the amount of goods purchased (vector) at that market scenario. Then the amount is affordable when $$\tilde{p}^J\cdot \tilde{x}^J\le m^J$$ 
There exists a strictly monotone [[Utility function]] rationalizing these preferences such that each observed, chosen $\tilde{x}^J$ maximises the utility. For this choice to be maximised, it must be on the budget line, $\tilde{p}^J\cdot \tilde{x}^J=m^J$

The budget line changes with each market scenario. Each J has its own budget line

## Revealed preference relationships
when observed, consumer chooses $\tilde{x}^J$ at prices and income $\tilde{p}^J$ and $m^J$ then $\tilde{x}^J$RP$\tilde{z}^J$ for any z at a particular market scenario such that $\tilde{p}^J\cdot \tilde{z}^J<m^J$

If RPs are different at different market scenarios, there is no utility function rationalizing the preference => no optimal choice

For a revealed preference to be valid, two criteria need to be satisfied
- Weak action of revealed preference ([[WARP]])
- Strong action of revealed preference ([[SARP]])
