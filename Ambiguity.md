Ambiguity refers to decision settings where it may not be possible for the DM to assign unique [[non additive probability|subjective probabilities]] to uncertain events. There may be uncertainty about probability, created by missing information that is relevant and could be known.

Representation of ambiguous probability:
- [[subjective expected utility problem (SEU)]]
- [[Choquet integral expected utility]]
- [[Maximin Expected Utility (MEU)]]

If $(v,u)$ is a CEU representation of $\succsim$ on $F$ and $v$ is convex, then these preferences have an equivalent MEU representation.
