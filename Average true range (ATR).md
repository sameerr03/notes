The average true range is a [[Technical Indicators|TI]] that is often used in conjunction with [[Bollinger Bands]]. It is an exponential moving average (typically 14 day) of the True range.

The true range is given by the maximum of 
- $H_t-L_t$
- $|H_t-C_{t-1}|$
- $|L_t-C_{t-1}|$

where $H$ is the high price, $L$ is the low price, $C$ is the close price, $t$ is today.
