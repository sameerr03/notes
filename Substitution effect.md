# Substitution effect
Goods are **substitutes** when one good is substitutble for the other incase of Price changes. If price of p2 increases, demand for x1 increases, substituting an amount of x2 for the consumers

The substitution effect is the effect on :: optimal consumption when just the prices of goods change, not the real income.

Red is after the change in prices, causing a change in consumer preference as some x2 is substituted for x1 due to a drop in x1s price. Under substitution effect,  the old optimal choice is on a lower [[indifference curves|IC]]. therefore demand of good 1 increases to reach the new optimum.
