An asset is a claim to future [[Cash flows]]. Financial assets always present some amount of risk. 

The two characteristics of a financial asset are:
- Returns
- Risk

### Returns
The returns obtained by an investor in a financial asset is dependent upon the **holding period** - the period for which the asset is held by the investor. The return on the financial asset over a holding period ($r$) is given by:$$r=\frac{\text{Price at the end of holding period}}{\text{Price at the start of holding period}}+\frac{\text{Dividends (if any)}}{\text{Price at the start of holding period}}-1$$  
### Modelling risk and return
The returns of an asset are more important in a forward looking direction, as this can inform investment or purchase decisions - by determining the price of the asset. In order to do this, we model future returns ($r$) as a [[random variables|random variable]]. We assume that it has the mean $\mathbb{E}(r)$ and variance $\text{Var}(r)=\sigma^2$. Further, we assume that this random variable is distributed [[Frequency distributions#Normal distributions|normally]] (for simplicity, rather than realism) with respect to $\mathbb{E}(r)$ and $\sigma^2$.
