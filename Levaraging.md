Levaraging is the act of borrowing money to invest it. It allows for a higher variance in the profits of the market. The overall idea is that a correct bet in the investment results in higher gains compared to being unleveraged. An investment of 100 with a gain of 100% leads to a total [[portfolio]] value of 200 but if 100 was borrowed then the same rate of return would result in a portfolio value of 400, resulting in higher profits after paying off debt compared to being unleveraged.
