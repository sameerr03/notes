Human cognition can be split up into two types called Type 1 and Type 2. 

Type 1/System 1 thinking - intuitive, automatic, autonomous - quick reasoning (reflexive and always engaged), lower cognitive effort.

Type 2/System 2 thinking - Slower, contemplative, reflective, deductive reasoning which is not always engaged, but can overrule system 1 thinking when engaged, requires cognitive effort. 

[[heuristics]] can be explained through the saving of cognitive efforts by using the less cognitively taxing System 1 thinking. System 1 thinking generates intuitive default responses on which the subsequent reflective system 2 processing may or may not intervene.
