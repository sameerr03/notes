# Exchange equilibrium
A 2 person economy model. $e_1,e_2$ are the amount the person has of each good to start with, their **endowment**. By selling their endowment, the decision maker can make an income, m. Therefore $$m=p_1e_1+p_2e_2$$ The endowment point is always on the [[Budget sets#Budget line|budget line]] as that level of consumption is always available to the DM.

The [[Budget sets|budget set]] becomes $$p_1x_1+p_2x_2\le p_1e_1+p_2e_2$$ By [[Utility function#Normalisation|normalizing]] the prices, the budget set has only one parameter. $$px_1+(1-p)x_2\le pe_1+(1-p)e_2$$ [[Optimization|Optimizing]] using this constraint in a regular [[Utility function#Cobb-Douglas function|Cobb-Douglas function]] leads to the optimal consumption points being $$\hat{x}_1=\frac{\alpha\ m}{p}$$ $$\hat{x}_2=\frac{(1-\alpha)\ m}{1-p}$$
m is a function of endowment and equillibrium, normalised prices, and so can be substituted in the optimal function to find equillibrium price.

## feasability conditions
For the two agents A and B, whose allocation is $(\tilde{x}^A,\tilde{x}^B)$ after exchange, it can only be feasable if $$\hat{x}_1^A+\hat{x}_1^B=e_1^A+e_1^B=E_1$$$$\hat{x}_2^A+\hat{x}_2^B=e_2^A+e_2^B=E_2$$ implying that no resources are left out. consumption=endowment. This can be represented by an edgeworth box.

Any point **in** the edgeworth box is a feasable allocation. $O_A$ from A pov and $O_B$ from B pov. 

## Exchange of goods
For exchange to be mutually beneficial to each party, there must be a "cigar of improvement".
![[Pasted image 20221009192917.png|300]]
Each party can move into a higher [[indifference curves|IC]] by changing the allocation to a point within the cigar. 

Optimal allocations for each good represent demand and sum of endowmnets represent supply. Equillibrium is only possible if Supply=Demand. At the equilibrium price this is achieved. 

$$z_1^A=x_1^A-e_1^A$$$$z_1^B=x_1^B-e_1^B$$In equillibrium, $$z_1^A+z_1^B=0$$ Similar for good 2. Such an equillibrium is only possible where the ICs of both parties are tangential to each other. 

When solving the model, equillibrium for only one good needs to be shown as equillibrium in one market implies equillibrium in the other by **Walras' law**. 

## Welfare theorems
1. equillibrium is always [[pareto efficient]]/optimal
2. any [[pareto efficient]] allocation is an equillibrium for certain endowments
