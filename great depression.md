# The great depression
The great depression was an extended [[business cycle|recession]] of the global economy during the late 1920s to 1935. Recessions can be due to either an inward shift of the [[IS curve|IS]] or [[LM curve]]s.

Data shows a decrease in the income and the interest rate => the IS curve shifted inwards to cause the recession.

## Causes
Stock market crashes → fall in [[investment]]→ leads to investments by [[bank]]s becoming risky
Leads to defaulting on loans taken by investors ⇒ run on the bank. Banks have no power to increase investment.

Aggravated by the 1930 policy which increased tax, leading to a fall in IS, furthering the great depression.
## Effects
During this period, nominal money supply fell as more money could not be printed and there was an unprecedented fall in prices, leading to higher real money supply despite a reduction in nominal money. Therefore the LM curve shifts outward, reducing the rate of interest. 

Pigou effect: When a fall in prices are realised by the public (common knowledge), consumption increases. Therefore the IS curve shifts outward. 

Despite these factors, the output of the economy did not increase.

### Deflation and investment
Fall in the prices realtive to nominal money is [[inflation|deflation]]. As a result of deflation, borrowers have to pay back more money than was lended. $$(M/P_2)(1+r)>>(M/P_1)(1+r)$$ when $P_1>P_2$ and $M/P_1$ was borrowed.

As money paid back increases, investment falls in the economy. The expectation of deflation reduces investment, thereby reducing Y.

$$Y=c(Y-T)+I(r-E\pi)+G$$
where
- $r-E\pi$ is the real interest rate
- r is the nominal rate
- $E\pi$ is the expectation of inflation

The deflation dominates the pigou effect and real money supply increase
