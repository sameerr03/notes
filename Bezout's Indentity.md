The greatest common divisor can be represented as $$\text{gcd}(a,b)
=am+bn, m,n\in \mathbb Z$$$$S_{a,b}=\{ax+by|x,y\in \mathbb Z, ax+by>0\}$$This [[Set theory|set]] $S_{a,b}\ne \emptyset$ if $a\ne 0$ as this implies that either$$a>0\implies a\in S_{a,b} (
x=1)$$or$$a<0\implies-a\in S_{a,b}(x=-1)$$
Therefore the set cannot be empty


If $p$ is a prime number, and $n\in \mathbb Z$, either $p|n$ or $\text{gcd}(p,n)=1$. This can be another definition of a prime number. 

We can make the claim that $p|ab\implies p|a$ or $p|b$
If $p\ \not| a$, $\text{gcd}(p,a)=1$. By bezout's identity, $$px+ay=1$$$$b\times(px+ay)=b$$$$pbx+aby=b$$We know that $p$ will divide $pbx$. However, it will also divide $aby$. This means that $p$ necessarily divides $b$
