# Frequency Distributions
## Descriptors of distribution
Central tendencies measure the central data of the sample. Variance and Standard deviation measure the spread around the central data
 ### Standard deviation
 The standard deviation describes how spread out the data is compared to the mean value. **Standard deviation formula** ($\sigma$)$$s=\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$$

  ### Variance ($\sigma^2$)
  The average of squared, standard deviations from the mean. **Variance formula**  $$s^2=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_1-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}$$
<!--SR:!2022-10-10,1,230-->
  This can be written as $$\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar{x})^2=\sum_{i=1}^nx_i^2-n\bar{x}^2$$

## Normal distributions
Distributions which are symmetric around the [[Measures of central tendency| mean]] are normal distributions

In these distributions, the [[Measures of central tendency|mean median and mode]] are the same

### Quartiles
Quartiles are a particular value in a frequency distribution, where $100p$% of the set are equal or lower than it $(0\le p\le 100)$

$q_3$ (upper quartile) (75th quartile)
$q_1$ (lower quartile) (25th quartile)

**percentiles** is the average of the npth and np+1th values (in ascending order)

### Outliers
Outliers are unexpected values that lie greatly out of the norm for the frequency distribution
- upper outlier:: greater than $\frac{3}{2} \times q_3$ (upper quartile) 
<!--SR:!2022-10-14,5,250-->
- lower outlier:: less than $\frac{3}{2} \times q_1$ (lower quartile)
<!--SR:!2022-10-15,6,230-->
### Range
The range of a distribution is the maximum - minimum
