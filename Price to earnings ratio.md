The price to earnings ratio of a company is its price per share divided by its earnings per share. The price-earnings ratio can tell us about whether a company is a good investment. From the [[Dividend Discount Model]] we can find the price to earnings ratio as$$\frac{P_0}{E_1^e}$$The price of the stock is given by $$\text{Price} = \text{No growth value per share}+\text{PVGO}$$where PVGO is the **[[Future and present values|present value]] of growth opportunities**. According to the [[Dividend Discount Model]],$$P_0 = \frac{E_1}{k}+\text{PVGO}$$In terms of price to earnings, this is given as $$\frac{P_0}{E_1^e} = \frac 1k(1+\frac{\text{PVGO}}{E_1^e/k})$$From the div. discount model, we know that for a stock,$$V_0 = \frac{E_1^e(1-b)}{k-g}$$if the price of a stock matches its value, $$\frac{P_0}{E_1^e}=\frac{1-b}{k-g}$$with higher levels of risk to the stock, its $\beta$ increases, implying that $k$ increases leading to a fall in its P/E ratio. 
### PEG ratio
This accounts for the growth issue in price to earnings ratio of a company. This is given by $$\text{PEG} = \frac{P/E}{g}$$Investment decisions can be based on 
- PEG = 1 => correct price
- PEG < 1 => underpriced
- PEG > 1 => overpriced

In terms of PVGO, $$\text{PEG} = \frac{ \frac 1k(1+\frac{\text{PVGO}}{E_1^e/k})}{g}$$
