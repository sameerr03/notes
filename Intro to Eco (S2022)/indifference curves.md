# Indifference curves
A visual representation of the set of all points that are indifferent to each other. [[Choice sets#Preferences|Preference]] relations are used to determine the indifference of the DM, allowing ICs to be created.

The lower the indifference curve, the less the [[Utility]] of all points lying on that curve for convex preference sets

The marginal rate of substitution (MRS) is the slope of the indifference curve and represents the tradeoffs that an individual is willing to make. 

Indifferent curves cannot intersect (else violates [[Choice sets#Transitivity|Transitivity]])

## Strictly monotone ICs
$$\tilde{x}>\tilde{y}$$then$$x_1\ge y_1$$ and so on. At least one such element of the vector x must be strictly better.
If $\tilde{x}>\tilde{y}$ then $\tilde{x} \succ \tilde{y}$. This is the **strictly monotone** condition. (Increasing function)

true only for -ve sloping ICs, with northeast direction of improvement, the band is thin (thick band results in a greater vector being indifferent). The ics are convex, meaning the weakly preffered set is convex. A line joining two points that are indifferent will be on a higher IC for strictly convex ICs. 

Monotone ICs are based on the preference that more of a good is preffered to less.  


### Calculating the MRS
The following assumptions are required for calculating MRS under monotone ICs
- choice set is complete, Transitive
- choice set is continuous => utility function is continuous
- A unique maximal element (strict monotonicity, strict convexity + convex budget set)
- IC is differentiable

Based on this the marginal rate of substitution of good x2 for good x2 can be calculated. If the function I(x) is the indifference curve function, 
$$x_2=I(x1)$$
To find the slope of the IC, we use the utility function which is equal to a constant utility value $\bar{U}$ as utility is fixed for an IC
$$U(x_1,x_2)=U(x_1,I(x_1))=\bar{U}$$Differentiating and using the chain rule, we get $$\frac{\delta U}{\delta x_1}dx_1+\frac{\delta U}{\delta x_2}dx_2=0$$$$U'_{x_1}dx_1+U'_{x_2}dx_2=0$$$$\frac{dx_2}{dx_1}=-\frac{U'_{x_1}}{U'_{x_2}}$$Finally, MRS = :: $$MRS=-\frac{U'_{x_1}}{U'_{x_2}}$$
The partial derivatives are the marginal utility for that good. The MRS is the ratio of the marginal utilities of the goods.
