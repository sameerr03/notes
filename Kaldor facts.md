1. Real rate of return on capital (Mainly government bonds) (r) shows no trend (No changes in the long run)  
2. Shares of income devoted to capital (Amount of income used to maintain capital $(rK/Y)$, and labour $(wL/Y)$ show no trend. For these to show no trend in a growth model,  and  should be flat. As Y increases in a growth model, K&L must increase at the same rate, which must be reflected in the model (balanced growth path)  
3. US â†’ steady growth rate untill 1961

#### Updated facts (Later decades)
1. Globalisation (increase in the extent of the market since the 1960s) - Lead to an increased flow of goods, ideas, finance, people. Ideas lead to technological innovation and are non-rival, i.e., can be used by multiple economic agents simultaneously to its full potential. 
2. There is accelerating growth rates, allowing for an expasion beyond the malthusian trap. Due to a feedback loop between ideas and population
3. Variation in the growth rates of per capita [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] increases with the distance from the technology frontier (US in the 60s). The poorer compared to the US, more variation in the growth rates with SSA having low and Korea having high. This is due to institutions.
4. Growth in capital per worker over time. THis is because $$\frac{K}{Y}=\frac{K/L}{Y/L}$$ which is the capital per worker/ GDP per labour. As GDP increase in a growth model and K/Y is constant for balanced growth, K/L must also be increasing.
5. Relative wages of skilled workers have remained flat
