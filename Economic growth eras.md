The [[Malthusian model]] results in an [[Equilibrium]] in which there is an income level just sufficient to allow a subsistence level of consumption. An increase in income due to an improvement in technology leads to an increase in population which thereby reduces [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] per captia, leading to stagnation.

#### 2. Post malthusian
A period that saw the industrial revolution, bringing about an area of constant technological advancement.  

#### 3. Modern Growth Regime
Industrial revolution brought about a demographic transition. Due to advancements in technology, healthcare could improve. Death rates reduced due to more money with the governments to invest in health care and better technology and awareness. Lower mortality rates led to fewer children as infant mortality rates fell. More money was also needed as an education become more important post the industrial revolution (job required technical knowledge). As a result fertility rates fell. These effects resulted in the technological advancements not being consumed by increases in population. 

Under the modern growth regime, western countries took off earlier. Further back in time the demographic transition occured, the richer the country is today. (Great divergence)
