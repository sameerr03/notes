Consists of 2 sides, supply and demand
## Supply side
$\bar{M}$ → nominal money  
$\bar{P}$ → prices in the economy  
$\bar{P}$ are inelastic in the [[Keynesian economics|short term]]. $\bar{M}$ is fixed in the short run as more money cannot be printed in the short term.

money supply, $(\frac{M}{P})^s=\frac{\bar{M}}{\bar{P}}$.
This term is fixed in the short term

## Demand side
liquidity is a state of money that prioritises ease of transactions. (Cash, demand deposits).

Money can be in bonds, fixed deposits, etc. where they generate interest, but they cannot be used in ordinary transactions (illiquid).

Based on r, a preference emerges in how much money should be kept in liquid forms -> **Theory of liquidity preferences**

As r increases, amount of illiquid money increases as the opportunity cost of keeping more liquid money is higher
$$(\frac{M}{P})^d=L(r)$$
## Supply and Demand

r*: equilibrium rate of interest where money supply = money demand. When r is above r*, liquid money demand is lower than supply. As a result, bond sellers and the government reduce return rates, creating demand for liquid money. When r is lower than r*, bond sellers increase r to get
more bonds, resulting in a decrease in liquid money demand.

$(\frac{M}{P})^d$ curve shifts up or down when a change occurs → ditermines a new equillibrium rate of intrest. 

However, Income also plays a factor in demand along with interest. An increase in income results in a higher preffered consumption, leading to increased liquid money demand. Therefore,
$$(\frac{M}{P})^d=L(r,Y)$$
As the demand increases with an increase in Y, when $Y_1$->$Y_2$,
