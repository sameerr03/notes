Materialism is the view that all facts are causally dependent on physical processes, or even reducible to them. 

The Marxist ideology believed that materialism based upon the productive forms of society evolving is what leads to changes in the larger structure of human nature and society.

Marxist materialism indicates that any change in social and economic structures is primarily due to any changes in the productive forces of society - technology, natural resource availability, etc - called "upwards production" (causality arrows)

The productive forces of the society is the productive ability of the society. Relations of productions are the ways in which people are categorized (class structure) and interact with one another. The superstructure is a society's political religious and legal systems and modes of thoughts and views of life. 

The productive forces of society begin to change the humans in nearest contact with these forces, and as a result slowly result in a change in society. However, existing class relations can come into contradictions with the newer productive forces (in the short run the superstructure can supress the productive forces but not in the long run).
