# Institutions
Institutions: The formal and informal rules the regulate social interaction among people and between people and the biosphere

Institutions often provide both [[Incentives]] and constraints within a system. The rules and constraints set in an institution can be shifted around by the players' bargaining power.

## The effect of institutions
The sum of the [[economic rent]]s of all parties involved is the surplus. The distribution of the surplus among the parties involved is based on the bargaining power of the player which is only feasable if the institutions allow for it
