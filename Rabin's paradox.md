Given the preference relation$$0\succ[11,0.5;-10,0.5]$$This implies a [[risk preference]] of risk averse as $\mathbb{E}(p)=0.5$ which is higher than zero. 
For a [[vNm Expected utility]] maximizer,
$$u(m)>\frac 12 u(m+11)+\frac 12 u(m-10)$$Where $m$ is the initial wealth of the DM. $$u(m+11)-u(m)<u(m)-u(m-10)$$$$\frac{u(m+11)-u(m)}{11}<\frac {10}{11}\cdot \frac{u(m)-u(m-10)}{10}$$![[Pasted image 20231121231049.png|400]]
This implies that
$$u'(m+11)<\frac{u(m+11)-u(m)}{11}$$where $u'(m+11)$ is the slope at $m+11$ (red).
$$\frac {10}{11}\cdot \frac{u(m)-u(m-10)}{10}<\frac {10}{11}u'(m-10)$$$$u'(m+11)<\frac{10}{11}u'(m-10)$$Therefore for every 21 dollars, the marginal utility must fall by $10/11$. This implies that the MU falls at a very fast rate. The $u$ function becomes flat at very high values of $m$ which is not realistic.

If our observations of risk preferences is based solely on the slope of EU curves, the we get strange results like this where MU falls at an incredible rate to accommodate this behavior. More to risk preferences than the slope of the EU curve.
