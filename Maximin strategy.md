A maximin stratergy is one where a player $i$ chooses stratergy $s_i\in S_i$ such that for all $s_{-i}\in S_{-i}$$$min_{s_{-i}}u_i(s_i,s_{-i})\ge min_{s_{-i}}u_i(s_i',s_{-i})$$for all $s_i'\in S_i$. 

This means that the player $i$ looks to maximise the minimum utility that they will get by choosing any pure stratergy. In the stag-rabbit game,

|1/2|Stag|Rabbit|
|---|---|---|
|Stag|2,2|0,1|
|Rabbit|1,0|1,1|

The maxmin stratergy for both players is to choose Rabbit. Therefore the maxmin stratergy equillibirum is $$MNSE=(Rabbit,\ Rabbit)$$
