### Sharpe ratio
The sharpe ratio compares the return of an investment to its risk. It mathematically expresses whether excess returns over the risk free rate are due to higher volatility or investor ability. The formula for the Sharpe ratio is:$$Sharpe\ Ratio=\frac{R_p-R_f}{\sigma_p}$$Where:
- $R_p$ is the expected return
- $R_f$ Risk free rate
- $\sigma_p$ [[Frequency distributions#Standard deviation]] of the portfolio

### Sortino Ratio
Sortino ratio modifies the sharpe ratio by only considering the standard deviation of negative returns (harmful volatility).$$Sortino\ Ratio=\frac{R_p-R_f}{\sigma_p}$$Where:
- $R_p$ is the expected return
- $R_f$ Risk free rate
- $\sigma_p$ [[Frequency distributions#Standard deviation]] of the negative returns of the portfolio.
