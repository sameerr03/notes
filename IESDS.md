# Equillibrium under iterated elimination of strictly dominant stratergies

This [[Equilibrium]] is reliant on the assumption that a player never plays a [[dominant stratergy#Strictly dominated stratergy|strictly dominated stratergy]], and that both players assume each other are [[Rationalizability|rational]](common knowledge of rationality (CKR)-> no doubt that the other player is rational).

Each player may have a stratergy that is available to them, that is strictly dominated. Under the assumption, we can remove the stratergy from their options. Repeatedly removing strictly dominated stratergies from both players results us being able to obtain a final equillibrium. Irrespective of the order that the stratergies are eliminated, the equillibrium remains the **same**.

Eg:

M strictly dominates B. Therefore, $P_1$ never chooses B. B is removed.  
L strictly dominates R. Therefore, $P_2$ never chooses R. R is removed.  
T strictly dominates M. Therefore, $P_1$ never chooses M. M is removed.
L strictly dominates C. This results in the final equillibrium being $(P_1,P_2):(T,L)$
