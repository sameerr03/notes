Uses [[Specific Factor Dynamics]] in a model of trade between two countries Home and Foreign($^*$). 

The PPFs for both countries are given by:

In order to find the [[Specific Factor Dynamics#Production (Supply side) equilibrium|optimal production]] in the countries in Autarky, we have to account for preferences of consumers. This is done through introducing ICs into the PPF functions.

At the optimal production levels in Autarky for each good, the slope of the point of tangency of the IC to the PPF ([[Specific Factor Dynamics#Production (Supply side) equilibrium|relative price]]) determines the [[Comparative advantage]]. In the example, $$\frac{P_F^A}{P_C^A}<\frac{P_F^A*}{P_C^A*}$$The relative price of food in the foreign country is greater then the autarky relative price of food at home. Therefore home has a comparative advantage in food production. 

In the Free Trade Equilibrium, due to the [[Ricardian trade model#Background (arbitrage condition)|arbitrage condition]], $$\frac{P_F^A}{P_C^A}<\frac{P_F}{P_C}=\frac{P_F^*}{P_C^*}<\frac{P_F^A*}{P_C^A*}$$The equalization of prices with trade implies that [[Specific Factor Dynamics#comparative statics|welfare]] increases for land owners, decreases for capital owners and is ambiguous at the home country. In the foreign country, land owners are worse off, capital owners are better of and workers are ambiguous. 

Compared to Autarky, in the free trade equilibrium, factors that are specific to to export sector are better of, factors specific to imports are worse off and factors in the mobile sector remain ambiguous.

#### Production feasible set vs budget set
Given the world prices in the free trade equilibrium, the home country produces $Y_F^T,Y_C^T$ of each good. This point must lie on the PPF as if it was within, resources are not being utilized optimally, and anything outside the frontier is not feasible. This is the point $T$.

At this point, the [[Specific Factor Dynamics#Production (Supply side) equilibrium|slope of the PPF]] is given by $$\frac{\text{MPL}_C}{\text{MPL}_F}=\frac{P_F^W}{P_C^W}\tag 1$$However, with trade, the home country is not just restricted to consumption of what it produces. By selling the goods it produces, it can use the income to buy more of some consumption good from the foreign country. The income of the home country is given by $$I^T=Y_F^TP_F^W+Y_C^TP_C^W$$A particular consumption bundle $X_C^T,X_F^T$ is affordable only if $$P_F^WX_F^T+P_C^TX_C^T\le I^T$$Given monotonic preferences, it does not make sense to spend less than your income. Therefore, $$P_F^WX_F^T+P_C^TX_C^T= I^T$$$$X_C^T=-\frac{P_F^W}{P_C^W}X_F^T+\frac{I^T}{P_C^W}\tag 2$$Graphically,

This is the **budget set** under the free trade equilibrium. It represents the tradeoff in consumption in the free trade equilibrium. The PPF on the other hand, represents the tradeoff in consumption in Autarky.

From (1) and (2) we can infer that at the point $T$, the slope of the budget line is equal to the slope of the PPF. This implies that at the point $T$, the tradeoff in consumption in the free trade equilibrium is equal to the tradeoff in consumption in autarky.

The point $Y_F^T,Y_C^T$ will be on the budget set as this point will be affordable as it is the amount of each good that home produces in FTE. Therefore we know that the budget set passes through the point $T$ with a slope equal to the PPE. Plotting this, we find that

The green area represents consumption bundles that are affordable in the free trade equilibrium but not feasible in Autarky. The amount of consumption bundles is more in FTE as home can buy more food from foreign and thus can consume more than it can produce.
