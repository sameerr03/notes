In this [[extensive form games|sequential game]], a firm wants to enter a market. There is already an incumbent firm in the market. The game tree is

Converting the game into a simultaneous game, there are two [[Nash equilibrium|PSNEs]], (O,P) and (I,A). However, (O,P) does not make sense as Accomodation once firm 1 enters [[dominant stratergy#Strictly dominant stratergy|strictly dominates]] starting a price war. The nash equillibrium does not make sense. 

Using [[Nash equilibrium#Sub game perfect Nash Equillibrium|backwards induction]],

Node $N_1$ is a pen terminal node. For player 2 at that node, A [[dominant stratergy#Strictly dominant stratergy|strictly dominates]] P. Therefore we remove P. The new game tree is ![[SmartSelect_Pin (4).jpg|500]]
Node $N_0$ is now a the pen-terminal node. For player 1, I strictly dominates O. Therefore the **outcome** is $$SPNE=(I,A)$$
