Mapping the returns of stocks onto [[frequency distributions]], we can determine that stocks do not follow returns according to the normal distribution. Stocks tend to return based on the Cauchy Distribution, which is like a bell shaped curve, with fatter tails. This allows for a significantly higher probability of an outlier in terms of return, either positive or negative as compared to that of the normal.
