# The multiplier effect
Numerically describes the effect of the [[multiplier process]]. The multiplier is the change in the [[aggregate demand]] when the output is increased by one unit.

Total change in the output can be greater than the initial change in [[aggregate demand]]. This is due to the circular flow of consumption, income and output. The **multiplier($k$)** represents the relative magnitude of the change. When 
- Multiplier = 1: The increase in [[Gross Domestic Product]] = The initial increase in spending 
- Multiplier > (<) 1: The increase in [[Gross Domestic Product]] > (<) The initial increase in spending

$$Y=AD$$
$$Y=C_0+C_1Y+I$$
$$Y(1-C_1)=C_0+I$$
$$Y=\frac{1}{1-C_1}\times(C_0+I)$$
$$\implies k=\frac1{1-C_1}$$

The multiplier actually depends on more than the tax rate, MPC and MPI. It also depends on the Rate of capacity utilization (phase of [[business cycle]]) and the expectations of the private sector (negative if rising fiscal deficit erodes consumer confidence)
