Insurance is a method of protection a DM can employ against a shock in order to [[consumption smoothing|consumption smooth]] over [[Consumption in states|two states]].

Consider two states, 
- 1: Negative Shock, probability $\pi$
- 2: No shock, probability $1-\pi$

In state 1, the overall wealth of the DM is affected, reducing to W-L, whereas it is maintained at W in state 2. The endowment point is (W-L,W) on the budget line. 

Y units of insurance are purchased by the DM at the price $\gamma<1$ before state is known.

In state 1, the shock is insured, so consumption is increased by $(1-\gamma)Y$ units wheras in state 2, consumption is decreased by $\gamma Y$ as insurance will not be paid for in the case of no shock. Lowe values of $\gamma$ correspond to cheaper insurance.

At tangency, the MRS = $$c'_2(c_1)=-\frac{\pi u'(c_1)}{(1-\pi)u'(c_2)}=-\frac{\gamma}{1-\gamma}$$

### Fairness of insurance

The insurance is fair if the expected payout of it is equal to the upfront payment. 

For a payout of Y with a probability $\pi$, the upfront payment is $\gamma Y$. The expected payout is $\pi Y$. Therefore the insurance is fair if $\gamma=\pi$. Actuarially unfair if $\gamma>\pi$.

### Feasable contingent consumption levels

The availability of insurance gives rise to different levels of consumption. The 45-degree line depicts the situation where consumption in both time periods is equal. This means that the insurance has covered the full amount of loss in state 1.

If the consumption in state 1 is greater than the consumption in state 2, the consumer is **over insured**. To the left of the 45 line is under insurance. To the left of the endowment point, the consumer is consuming more in state 2 than state 1. This implies that the insurance has been sold.

### Optimal insurance level

In order to determinethe optimal level of insurance that a consumer will purchase, we must maximise the exected utility function of the consumer. $$max\ \pi u(W-L+(1-\gamma)Y)+(1-\pi)u(W-\gamma Y)$$ in terms of Y. can be used to find optimum c1 and c2. 
this results in the number of dollar units of insurance that is optimal for the consumer to purchase.
