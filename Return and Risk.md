Returns are the gains from an investment in a stock. 

The returns of an investment in dollars is given by $$\text{Dollar Returns}=\text{Dividend}+\text{Change in Market Value}$$The percentage returns of an investment is given by $$\text{Percentage Return}=\frac{\text{Dollar Returns}}{\text{Beginning Market Value}}=\frac{\text{Dividend + Change in Market Value}}{\text{Beginning Market Value}}$$This is equivalent to $$\text{Percentage Return}=\text{Dividend yield}+\text{Capital Gains Yield}$$
#### Holding Period return
The return an investor would get when holding an investment over a period of $T$ years, when the returns during year $i$ is $R_i$.$$\text{HPR}=(1+R_1)\times(1+R_2)\times\dots\times(1+R_T)-1$$
#### Return statistics
The arithmetic mean is the normal average of returns (measures the average return for each period during a particular amount of time)$$\bar R=\frac{R_1+\dots +R_T}{T}$$This average return does not capture the effect of the compound return per period over multiple periods. $$\text{GAR/CAGR}=[(1+R_1)\times(1+R_2)\times\dots\times(1+R_T)]^{1/T}-1$$
This return is typically lower than the arithmetic mean. However, it is a more accurate measure of returns longer term as it captures the effect of compounding

However, there is risk associated with this return. One way of measuring this risk is through the standard deviation/ variance of the return. $$\text{SD}=\sqrt{\text{VAR}}=\sqrt{\frac{(R_1-\bar R)^2+(R_2-\bar R)^2+\dots+(R_T-\bar R)^2}{T-1}}$$A typical assumption in finance is that returns on a [[Financial Assets|financial asset]] are distributed normally. The distribution of returns will then be $R \sim N(\bar R, \text{VAR})$


The **risk premium** is the additional return over and above the risk free, that results from bearing additional risk. The risk free rate is typically considered to be short term treasury bills of the US

#### US equity risk premium
The US ERP was 5.4% in the earlier years, with it becoming 7.2% from 1900-2010, versus 6.9% in the rest of the world. 

An ERP of 7% seems like a reasonable estimate of future equity returns.
