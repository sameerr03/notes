Assignment 1 q2,
A fair coin is tossed twice. Two choice problems containing lotteries are offered to the DM. 
CP1: 2400 for sure ($p$); 10000 for HH, 0 otherwise ($q$)
CP2: pay 7500 for sure $(p')$; pay 0 for HH, 10000 otherwise ($q'$)

|Outcomes:|HH|HT|TH|TT|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|$p$|2400|2400|2400|2400|
|$q$|10,000|0|0|0|
|$p'$|-7500|-7500|-7500|-7500|
|$q'$|0|-10000|-10000|-10000|
|$p$ in CP1 and $q'$ in CP2|2400|-7600|-7600|-7600|
|$q$ in CP1 and $p'$ in CP2|2500|-7500|-7500|-7500|

The DM chooses $p$ and $q'$, the combination which is strictly dominated by $q$ and $p'$.

Asset integration should not be used if operating on notions of losses and gains (loss aversion).
