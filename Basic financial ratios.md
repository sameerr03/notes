These are ratios that describe various aspects of a companies finances and can be potential indicators of their financial wellbeing. However, these ratios by themselves are not indicative of the health of the businesses and industry wide comparisons need to be made in order to gain any sort of information from these ratios. 

### Working Capital Ratio
Evaluates the working capital or the difference between the [[Intro to Eco (S2022)/balance sheet|current assets]] and current liabilities of a company. (Can also be total liabilities. If the price of the company is less than the working capital, the company is a bargain). The working capital ratio is given by $$\text{WKR}=\frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current liabilities}}$$A ratio above one implies that a company has enough capital to pay off its short term debt and does need to take on additional liabilities. However during business restructuring this could be temporarily below 1. 

### Quick Ratio
A ratio used to gain a measure of the liquidity of a company. It represents whether a companies assets can be converted to cash in order to pay off short term liabilities. It excludes inventory as inventory requires time to be converted into cash.$$\text{QR}=\frac{\text{Current assets}-\text{Inventory}}{\text{Current liabilities}}$$A company with a higher than 1 quick ratio indicates that it has enough liquid cash to pay off its short term liability and continue operations (or immediate reinvestment)

### Earnings per Share
Earnings per share is a measure of profitability of a company and can be used to gain a measure of a companies value (in terms of purchase decisions or as just an investment). A weighted average is taken of all the common stock outstanding during a year (Common stock not held by the company itself). $$\text{EPS}=\frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Weighted Average}}$$A higher EPS indicates greater value

### P/E ratio
ratio used to determine the price of an asset relative to its earnings. Reflects how much investment is required in order to receive one dollar of earnings. $$\text{P/E}=\frac{\text{Current stock price}}{\text{Earnings per share}}$$A high P/E ratio can indicate high growth or an overvaluation of a company. A low P/E ratio implies low earnings and a slow growing company or an undervaluation of the company. 

### Debt to Equity ratio
This ratio measures how much of a companies funding comes from debt and how much from equity. Indicates whether shareholder equity can cover all the debts. A company with a high D/E ratio can be in financial trouble or can be using leverage for better income. This give a brief idea of the risk a potential investment poses. Needs to be analyzed in terms of industry norms.$$\text{D/E}=\frac{\text{Total liabilities}}{\text{Total shareholder's equity}}$$  
### Return on Equity (ROE)
Describes how effectively a company uses shareholder money in order to make a profit. A history of strong ROE implies that a company's management has a good history of making good use of shareholder money. It uses net income (income less tax and expenses) before paying common stock dividends and after paying preferred stock dividends. This is expressed as a percentage of common stock equity value. $$\text{ROE}=\frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Total shareholder's equity}}$$
