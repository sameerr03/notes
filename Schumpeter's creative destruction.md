Unlike the [[Romer model]], Creative destruction completely replaces old technology with new technology. In Romer, all innovations add to the total capital stock, In CD only the latest innovation accounts for capital goods. Like the romer model, this model also uses the three sector method to model the economy.

The production function of the economy is given by $$Y=K^\alpha(A_iL_Y)^{1-\alpha}$$
Where:
- $i$ denotes the version of a capital good. The higher $i$ means a higher value of $A_i$. 
- $i-1$ or any other iteration does not exist in the model, implying that no final goods firm uses earlier versions of capital goods.

In order to model the rate of technological growth, we need to find out how much an increase in $i$ by 1 results in $A$.$$A_{i+1}=(1+\gamma)A_i$$$$\gamma=\frac{A_{i+1}-A_i}{A_i}$$Where $\gamma$ is the step size or the rise in productivity with each innovation. The R&D sector is only focused on getting the technology to the next level of $i$. However, only one person is able to reap the benefits of selling the patent, everyone else looses out. The probability of the researcher producing the new idea is given by $$\bar\mu=\frac{\theta L_A^{\lambda-1}}{A_i^{1-\phi}}$$Which is identical to the [[Solow model - with ideas]]. If $\lambda<1$, having more people working on the same idea negatively affects the probability of each person finding the idea. If $\phi<1$, more technology makes further innovation harder. For the aggregate economy, the probability of an idea in the current time period is given by, $\bar\mu L_A$$$P=\bar\mu L_A=\theta\frac{L_A^\lambda}{A^{1-\phi}}$$
However, since the growth rate of $A$ is dependant on a probability at each time period, and is a sudden jump by $\gamma$, the growth of $A$ is a step function. In order to find a constant probability we look at long run growth rate. Via the law of large numbers, the long run average converges to the expected value. $$E[\frac{\dot A}A]=\bar\mu L_A\gamma$$  where $\gamma$ is the jump with an innovation and $\bar\mu L_A$ is the probability of an innovation. Expanding,$$E[\frac{\dot A}A]=\gamma\ \theta\frac{L_A^{\lambda}}{A_i^{1-\phi}}$$For the growth rate to be constant over time (balanced growth path), $L_A^\lambda$ must grow at the same rate as $A_i^{1-\phi}$. Taking expected value of $A$ and usign log-derivatives,$$(1-\phi)E[\frac{\dot A}A]=\lambda\frac{\dot L_A}{L_A}$$$$E[\frac{\dot A}A]=\frac{\lambda\dot{L_A}/L_A}{1-\phi}$$Assuming that growth rate of labour in r&d is $n$,$$E[\frac{\dot A}A]=\frac{\lambda n}{1-\phi}$$which is identical to the growth rate in the [[Romer model]].

A change in $\gamma$ has no effect on the long run growth rate as there is conflicting effects on $A$. greater $\gamma$ increases $A$ more, but results in the next jump more difficult to acheive, i.e. the next innovation is harder. 

### Derivation based on [[Romer model]]
#### Final goods sector
$$Y=L_Y^{1-\alpha}A_i^{1-\alpha}x_i^\alpha$$Where $x_i$ is the amount of intermediate good used associated with $i$$$\Pi=L_Y^{1-\alpha}A^{1-\alpha}_ix_i^\alpha -wL_Y-p_ix_j$$Maximising the profits, the first order conditions are:$$w=(1-\alpha)\frac{Y}{L_Y}$$$$P_i=\alpha L_Y^{1-\alpha}A_i^{1-\alpha}x_i^{\alpha-1}$$
#### Intermediate goods sector
Only one firm owns the patent to produce the latest verion of the technology $i$. Therefore the system is a monolpoly, similar to romer. The profit function is$$\pi_i=p_i(x_i)x_i-rx_i$$Similar to the romer model, the price of the good $x_i$ is given by $$p_i=\frac1{1+\frac{p'_i(x_i)x_i}{p_i}}r$$The term in the elasticity is the price elasticity. As the FOC of the profit function is the same as romer, the elasticity is $\alpha -1$. Therefore,$$p_i=\frac r\alpha$$The firm in this case also charges above the marginal cost. This means that the intermediate firm makes a profit. As this is the only firm that produces at the current technology level, the profit of all the firms in the [[Romer model]] is just for this firm. $$\pi_i=\alpha(1-\alpha)Y$$Also, since $x_i$ is all that is being produced, $x_i=K$$$Y=K^\alpha(AL_Y)^{1-\alpha}$$Similar to romer then, $$rK=\alpha^2 Y$$
#### R&D sector
The price of patent is based on no arbitrage equation. However, in this case, the price of the patent can either be invested, or can be used to generate profits untill the next inovation is made. Unlike romer, technology can jump right when the patent is purchased, making it obsolete, which is accounted for in the modified equation$$rP_A=\pi+\dot{P_A}-(\bar\mu L_A)P_A$$
$$r=\frac\pi {P_A}+\frac{\dot P_A}{P_A}-\mu$$where $\mu=\bar\mu L_A$. From the [[Kaldor facts]], we know that $r$ is constant. This means that $\pi$ and $P_A$ must grow at the same rate. From the profit equation for the intermediate firms, we know that $\pi$ grows at the same rate as $Y$, $n+g$. Hence $P_A$ must grow at the same rate. If the expected rate of growth of technology is $g$ and we know that $g=\bar\mu L_A\gamma$,  Hence,$$r=\frac\pi{P_A}+(\gamma\mu+n)-\mu$$$$P_A=\frac\pi{r-n+\mu(1-\gamma)}$$**Arrow replacement effect:** With the new version of technology, incumbent firms loose their streams of profits. They have their accumulated profit to loose and as a result do not bid for the newer patent. A challenger will always bid higher for the patent. This means that there are new firms always coming into existence.

#### Labour equilibrium
Labour force can either work in final sector or in the intermediate sectors. In equillibrium, the value of either is the same.$$w=\bar\mu P_A$$$$(1-\alpha)\frac Y{L_Y}=\bar\mu \frac\pi{r-n+\mu(1-\gamma)}$$Expanding in a similar fashion to the [[Romer model]], we get![[Pasted image 20230323203436.png|400]] $$s_R=\frac 1{1+\frac{r-n+\mu(1-\gamma)}{\alpha\mu}}$$
