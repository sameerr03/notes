Economic (business) organisations in which private owners of capital goods  (Technology) hire labor to produce goods and services for sale in markets for profit. Firms are the main form of economic organization in capitalism. Organisations that are not for profit are not considered firms.


## Differences to markets
| Firms | Markets|
|---|---|
|Economic power is concentrated in the hands of owners/managers|Power is decentralised - purchases result from the buyers and sellers' autonomous decisions|
|[[contract]]s in firms temporarily transfer authority over a persons activities from the employee to the manager or owner|Contracts for products in markets permanently transfer ownership of the good from seller to buyer|
|[[Social Interactions]] within firms can extend over long periods of time. Working in a firm typically means acquiring a network of associates who are essential to a task|Market interactions are typically short lived|

## Firm behaviour

Firms pattern of production: Buy input -> use technology -> produce/sell output
Firm behaviour is thus determined by three factors
- Optimal level of input for a given level of output
- optimal level of output for a given price
- Whether to remain a firm (to produce at all)

The two input production function is $y=f(x_1,x_2)$. All combinaitons of $x_1,x_2$ that produce the same output form the **isoquant curve**. The slope of the curve is the **Marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS)**, the ratio of marginal products.

The constraint is the cost function: $C(x_1,x_2)=w_1x_1+w_2x_2$. All combinations of $x_1,x_2$ that have the same cost is the **isocost curve**. The quantities are optimised by taking the highest isoquant at the lowest isocost.

### Minimising cost

$$min\ wx_1+wx_2$$ such that $f(x_1,x_2)=\bar{y}$

$$\mathcal{L}(x_1,x_2,\lambda)=wx_1+wx_2-\lambda(f(x_1,x_2)-\bar{y})$$
$$\frac{w_1}{w_2}=MRTS$$
### Maximising output

Taking optimal x1 and x2 values from earlier and substitutiong it into the cost function in order to get the [[Utility function#Indirect utility function|Indirect]] [[Cost Function]] $c(y)$.

We need to maximise $$\pi=py-c(y)$$$$p-c'(y)=0$$$$p=c'(y)=MC(y)$$$$y=MC^{-1}(p)$$ which is the supply curve

### Viability



### Assumptions
- Firms can change inputs at no additional costs
- Technology is monotone: more of one or both inputs -> production increases 
- Technology is convex (concave function: fucntional value of convex combination > convex combination of funtional values $f(\lambda x+(1-\lambda)y)>\lambda f(x)+(1-\lambda)f(y)$))


## Structure
Firms typically have many owners. These owners are individuals and institutions that own shares issued by a firm. Managers take strategically important diecisions, and issue commands to the employees.

## Pay Structure
Owners are **residual claimants**. They take whatever is remains after revenues have been used to pay employees, managers, suppliers, creditors, and taxes. The managers use the funds of the owners to execute decisions. However, the separation of ownership and control between the owners and managers can result in a potential conflict of interest.

### Conflict of Interest
As managers may not be residual claimants, they might not take profit maximizing actions that owners may desire. They may choose actions that benefit themselves at the expense of the owners. Conflict of interest can be avoided by:
- Structure contracts such that managerial compensation depends on performance
- Additional supervision of the manager

## Employment
Creating an [[employment rent]] will be very beneficial to the employer. It allows for the employers to retain employees by threatening the termination of the their jobs and the employee will be more intrinsically motivated to stay at the firm.

### Determining wages of the employee
![[Pasted image 20220327193630.png]]
The workers [[employment rent#Reservation Wage|reservation wage]] is 6, above which they begin to exert effort on their job, as shown in the curve. This curve (which is an indifference curve for the worker) becomes the [[technically feasable set]] for the employer. The employers indifference curves are isocost lines, slope of which determine the unit of effort/dollar. The employer wants to get the steepest slope to maximize profits. The best he can do is a slope tangential to the best response curve of the worker, where MRS of his isocost lines = MRT of the workeres response curve
