MACD or Moving average convergence divergence is a [[Technical Indicators|TI]] that uses moving averages in order to indicate market trends. 

The MACD boils down to a difference between a slow and fast moving ema. The typical values are 26-day for slow moving ema and 12-day for a fast moving ema. The MACD curve is given by $$12EMA-26EMA$$A typically 9 day EMA of the MACD is taken, called a signal line, which is superimposed onto the MACD curve. If the MACD line crosses above the signal line it indicates a bullish trend whereas if the MACD crosses below the signal line it indicates a bearish trend

MACD is prone to many false positives - needs to be considered in conjunction with other indicators and should not solely inform buy/sell decisions.
