The future value of money is [[Intertemporal consumption|discounted]] as humans are inherantly  impatient. A dollar will be worth more tomorrow as it can be put into a bank where it earns [[Compound interest]]. As it is an asset that grows over time, its present value is given by
$$\frac 1{(1+r)^n}$$where $n$ is the number of years

Bonds have regular return on the amount paid to purchase the bond, known as a coupon. the time taken is the term which is the time taken for the bond to mature, or the price of the bond to be returned along with interest. When bonds are sold at par (100 dollars), it means that they are sold at their actual value. if $c$ is the price of a coupon, $$P=c(\frac 1r-\frac{1}{(1+r)^T}\frac 1r)+\frac{100}{(1+r)^T}$$Using this eqaution, the yeild (r) of the bond can be calculated to maturity. Bonds are sold with a price and a coupon value. The yeild at the end of the term is given by r which is computed using this equation. This equation is important as the price of the bond can fluctuate over time. As the coupon value of the bond is fixed, if the price increases $r$ decreases and so the bond will have a lower yeild than what it was bought with, making it worth it to sell the bond.
