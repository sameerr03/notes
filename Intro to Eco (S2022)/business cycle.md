# Business Cycle
the **Business cycle** is the alternating periods of positive and negative growth rates in economic growth

**Recessions** are periods when output is declining or below normal level. 

The business cycle affects labour market outcomes - shocks and changes in the [[aggregate demand]] can cause cyclical unemployment.
