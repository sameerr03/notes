### Cash flow to the firm
The free cash flow is the cash flow to the investors of the firm. The free cash flow is given by $$\text{FCF} = \text{EBIT}-\text{Taxes}+\text{D\&A}-\text{CAPEX}-\Delta\text{NWC}$$This is the cash flow to both the equity and debt investors of the firm. This is the payoff in each time period of the firm. The discount rate used for calculation is the [[Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)]]. Therefore the value of the firm is given by $$V_0 = \sum_{t=1}^{T-1}(\frac{\text{FCF}_t}{(1+\text{WACC})^t})+\frac{\text{FCF}_T+V_T}{(1+\text{WACC})^T}$$where $$V_T = \frac{\text{FCF}_T(1+g)}{\text{WACC} - g}$$This is the terminal value of the firm. We assume that the firm grows at the rate $g$. 

### Cash flow to equity
The cash flow to equity is given by $$\text{FCFE}=\text{FCF}-I\times (1-T)+\text{Net increase in Debt}$$where $I$ is the interest expense of the firm and $T$ is the tax rate and net change in debt is new debt - old debt. The valuation of the firm is given by $$V_0 = \sum_{t=1}^{T-1}(\frac{\text{FCFE}_t}{(1+k)^t})+\frac{\text{FCFE}_T+V_T}{(1+k)^T}$$where $$V_T= \frac{\text{FCFE}_T(1+g)}{k - g}$$and the discount rate is given by $k$ using the [[Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)]] equation $$k=r_f+\beta[\mathbb E(r_M)-r_f]$$The beta used here is the unlevered beta. It removes the effect of debt on risk of the firm. It is given by $$\beta_{UL} = \frac{\beta_L}{(1+(1-T)\times\frac BS)}$$
