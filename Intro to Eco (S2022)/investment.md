Creating new capital goods is investment for a [[firm]]. 
Investment that is not sold in the year of production is stored as :: **inventory**

A basic investment function is :: $$I=f-k(r)$$

Where:
- r is the Interest rate of the economy. Money returned on bank deposits
- f is the autonomous investment in the economy (when r=0)  
- k is the investment elasticity to rate of interest (change in investment to 1 unit of r)

If return on investment is higher than r then investment will be preffered. Higher r, fewer projects will gain investment. Therefore a negative relation between interest rates and investment.

## Gross and net Investment
Gross Investment:: investment + change in inventory (can be the or -ve)

Net investment :: Gross Investment - depreciation

## Investment and [[Savings function|Savings]]
In a simple economy (no government and foreign trade) $$I=S$$
With governments and foreign trade, [[Disposable income]]$$DI=Y+TR-TX$$$$C+S=Y+TR-TX$$$$C+S=(C+I+G+NX)+TR-TX$$$$S=I+(G+TR-TX)+NX$$
Savings= Investment + Budget deficit (government spending - govenment earnings) + net exports. 


## Investment as a consumption smoothing method
Investment is another method to [[consumption smoothing]]

## Investment of [[firm]]s
Firms do not have preferences for consumtion smoothing like households. They adjust investments to temporary and permanent shocks in order to maximise profits. 

High demand -> higher capacity utilization -> investment -> even higher demand

Investment decisions depend on firms' future demand expectations. Business confidence coordinates firms to invest at the same time (coordination is important for positive returns on investment). As business confidence can be volatile, investment is more volatile than [[Gross Domestic Product]].
