A virtual environment is a separate place for each workspace/project - do not affect each other. To create a virtual environment in anaconda, the following code can be used 

`conda --name <name> python=<python version>`

In order to view all the different virtual environments,

`conda info --envs`

In order to choose a particular environment

`conda activate <environment name>`
