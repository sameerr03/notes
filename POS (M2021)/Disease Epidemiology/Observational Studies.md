# Observational studies
## Prevalence and Incidence
### Prevalence
**Prevalence** is the total number of individuals in a population who have a specific condition at a specific point in time (Expressed as % of population). The types of prevalence are:
- Point Prevalence: Population at risk at one point in time
- Period Prevalence: Population at risk during a defined period of time
### Incidence
**Incidence** is the number of individuals who develop specific diseases or experience a specific health related event during a particular time.

### Longitudinal studies
A study that involves looking at the relationship between disease and other variables of interest as they exist in a defined population over an extended period of time.
#### Types of longitudinal study
**Prospective study** 
A study where the participants already have a known exposure. Research looks forward in time to determine outcome. Prevalence is measured in exposed and unexposed group to determine outcomes and causality in the future with follow up surveys after a time period

**Retrospective study**
A study where the participants already have a known disease or outcome. Research looks back in time to determine exposure. Possible sources of exposure are noted in the group that have had the outcome compared to those that have not had the outcome
   
**Case-Control study**
A study that identifies both cases and controls. Prevalence of exposure to a potential risk factor is compared between cases and controls. If prevalence is higher in case group, then risk factor is likely the cause of outcome. Always retrospective

**Cohort study**
A Cohort is a collection of people who share an experience or characteristic over time. Cohort is concerned with frequency of disease in exposed and non exposed individuals (better for rare cases) while case control is concerned with frequency and amount of exposure in subjects. Subjects are enrolled in cohorts on the basis of exposure and in cases based on whether they have the disease of interest or not

### Cross-Sectional studies
Cross-Sectional: Examines the relationship between disease and other variables of interest as they exist in a defined population at a single point in time or over a short period of time

### Example of an Observational Study: British Doctors Study
-   Prospective Cohort study of British doctors. The cohorts were of the doctors who smoked and those who didn't
-   Their smoking habits, their diseases and when they died were all kept track of for 50 years
-   The conclusion was that smoking reduces lifespan by upto 10 years and smoking causes a variety of lung and heart related diseases
-   However, these studies have problems establishing causal relationships in the presence of [[Confounders and Covariates]]
