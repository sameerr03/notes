A range of investments held by a person or an economic [[firm]]

#### Portfolio expected value and variance
Suppose $x$ dollars are in a portfolio that is investing into two assets. 

##### Risky and riskless asset
Risky asset ($r_1$): $x$ dollars
Riskless asset ($r_f$): $1-x$ dollars

Expected return of the portfolio ($r$) is
$r=xr_1+(1-x)r_f$

The [[Frequency distributions#Variance ($ sigma 2$)|variance]] of the portfolio is given by
$x^2var(r_1)$

##### 2 Risky assets
Risky asset 1 ($r_1$): $x$ dollars
Risky asset 2 ($r_2$): $1-x$ dollars

Expected return of the portfolio ($r$) is
$r=xr_1+(1-x)r_2$

The [[Frequency distributions#Variance ($ sigma 2$)|variance]] of the portfolio is given by
$x^2var(r_1)+(1-x)^2var(r_2)+2x(1-x)cov(r_1,r_2)$

With two risky assets, [[Stock Covariance]] matters as positive covariance can result in both stocks doing well or badly simultaneously, leading to higher variance of the overall portfolio. Variance is reduced by negatively corellated stocks. 

#### Efficient portfolio frontier
Varying $x$, we can observe both the expected return on the portfolio as a whole (on the y axis) and the standard deviation of the stock on the x axis (to understand the risk at that value of $x$).

The shaded area represents a **dominated region**. Instead of these values of $x$, better values can be chosen as there are points on the curve that have higher return with lower or equal risk. Any point on the curve is feasable, but is determined by the investors preferences about how much risk they wish to take on
