$M_0$: Currency in circulation (currency in circulation, currency not in bank reserves). Simply, it is the cash, coins, or "hard currency" in circulation

$M_1:$ Currency in circulation  
	+ Demand deposits with the banking system 
	+ currents deposits with the banking system 

##### In the US
$M_1:$ currency in the hands of non-public 
	+ demand deposits
	+ other checkable deposits 
	+ traveller's checks

##### In Canada
$M_1:$ Currency in hands of non-bank public
	+ demand deposits less float 
	+ Adjustments

### Money multipliers
According to the [[Bank reserve ratios]] model, if all the deposits are $H=N_th_t$

The total cash held according to $M_1$ will be 

Cash held by public = 0
	+ Demand Deposits = $H$
**Total: $M_1 = H$**

Total cash held by the banks is $\gamma H$, as mandated by the [[Bank reserve ratios]]. Therefore:
$M_0:\gamma H$

This implies that $$M_1=\frac 1 \gamma M_0$$Here, $\frac 1\gamma$ is the **money multiplier**. Keeping $M_0$ constant, an increase in $\gamma$ increases $M_1$ and a decrease in $\gamma$ decreases $M_1$.

#### According to [[bank loans from central banks]],

Cash held by public = 0
	+ Demand Deposits = $H$
**Total: $M_1 = H$**

$M_0:$ is the amount the bank keeps in cash. ($\delta\gamma H$ is loaned to the bank and the bank has to pay it back which is why it is not counted in the money supply of the country). Therefore, from the balance sheet we can see that this amount is:
$M_0=(1-\delta)\gamma H$

This implies that $$M_1=\frac{1}{(1-\delta)\gamma}M_0$$Here, $\frac{1}{(1-\delta)\gamma}$ is the money multiplier.
