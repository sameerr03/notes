# Shocks
A shock is an unexpected event that causes the [[Gross Domestic Product]] to fluctuate

There are two broad types of shocks:
- Good or Bad fortune on the *household*: Disease, injury, gifts
- Good or Bad fortune on the *entire economy*: War, drought, earthquake

## Household Shocks
Stratergies to deal with shocks that are specefic to their household:
- Self-insurance: saving and borrowing
- Co-insurance: support from social network or govt.

Households prefer to smooth their consumption [[consumption smoothing]]

## Economy Wide Shocks
Co-insurance is less effective if the entire economy is affected. It is however, even more necessary. In farming economies in volatile climates, co-insurance based on trust and [[altruism]] was practiced.

### Demand Shocks
An unexpected change in [[aggregate demand]]. government can stabilize the economy through both [[Fiscal Policy]] (tax cuts and increased govt. spending) and [[Intro to Eco (S2022)/monetary policy]] (decrease nominal interest rate).
