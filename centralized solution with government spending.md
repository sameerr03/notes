The feasibility set needs to be changed from the [[social planner solution]] in order to account for government expenditure, which can be used in order to make conclusions about welfare with government spending in the [[Inflation model]]. The feasibility set is given by
$$N_{t-1}c_{2,t}+N_tc_{1,t}+G_t\le N_ty$$$$c_{1,t}+\frac{N_{t-1}}{N_t}c_{2,t}+\frac 1{N_t}G_t\le y$$if $G_t/N_t=g_t$, then$$c_{1,t}+\frac1nc_{2,t}+g_t\le y$$

In the stationary allocation,$$c_1+\frac 1nc_2\le y-g$$
