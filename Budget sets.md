# Budget sets
Budget sets are a type of choice set that rely on the amount of money ([[income]]) with the desicion maker and the [[market conditions]]. Budget sets are represented in the form of $$(\tilde{x}\in\mathbb{R} \ | \ \tilde{p}\cdot\tilde{x}\le m)$$
Where:
($m$) is the income level, the price of goods is represented by the vector $\tilde{p}$ where $\tilde{p}>>0$ and the quanitiy of the corresponding good is represted by the vector $\tilde{x}$

## Budget line
The budget set can be represented as a subset of the budget set as
$$(\tilde{x}\in\mathbb{R} \ | \ \tilde{p}\cdot\tilde{x}=m)$$
This equation represents the limit of what can be afforded within the budget. A two dimentional vector economy will result in the budget line $$p_1x_1+p_2x_2=m$$ after expanding the dot product$$x_2=\frac{m}{p_2}-\frac{p_1}{p_2}x_1$$

This results in a linear equation with $\frac{m}{p_2}$ as the intercept and $-\frac{p_1}{p_2}$ as the slope, giving the graph

### Effects of changes on the budget line
- Income shifts in the budget line result in :: a parallel shift of the budget line
- Price shifts in the budget line result in :: a change in slope
- Increase in prices or decrease in budget result in :: the shrinking of the budget set

#### Rationing
Rationing sets a definite limit to the quantity of a particular good. The decision maker cannot buy any more of the good beyond this amount, resulting in higher quantities being excluded from the budget set

#### Taxes and Subsidies
Taxes increase the price per unit of one good by $1+\tau$ where $\tau$ is the tax rate.
Subsidies decrease the price per unit of one good by $1-\tau$ where $\tau$ is the subsidy rate.

#### Shipping costs
Once an amount of the good is purchased shipping costs must be paid.

At 0, the shipping cost is not counted but when an $\epsilon$ of the good is added the whole shipping cost is paid, leading to the budget line shifting to the amount of the other good that can be purchased with the budget - shipping cost

#### Discounts
Discounts affect the slope of the graph as the price per good varies on the amount of good purchased. More of the good is purchasable at higher quantities. The graph becomes step-linear with theslope changing at the points where the discount changes.
