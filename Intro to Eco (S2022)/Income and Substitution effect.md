Budget Constraint: An equation that represent all combinations of goods and services that one could aquire that exactly exhaust one's budgetary resource. 
The constraint is: $$c=w(24-t)$$

If the wage is 15, the w=15. This gives the [[Feasable Frontier]]:

## Income effect
The effect that additional overall effect would have if there were no changes in the price or opportunity cost (MRT). The feasable frontier expands, allowing for a point on a higher [[indifference curves]] where MRS=MRT is optimum.

The effect that the additional income would have if there were no change in the price or [[opportunity cost]]

## Substitution effect
The effect that is only due to changes in the price or opportunity cost, given the new level of utility. 

If the wage increases w=25 then the constraint is now
$$c=25(24-t)$$which results in a steeper frontier

In this case, the opportunity cost of free time is higher, and therefore MRT has increased. As a result there is an incentive to work more. This is the substitution effect(The effect that is only due to changes in the price or opportunity cost, given the new level of utility).

## Overall effect
If the income effect is larger, than free time will increase but if substitution effect is larger, free time will reduce
