[[Lotteries]] are always associated with risk. The [[vNm Expected utility]] of a lottery is not enough to determine whether a lottery is lucrative or not. 

One measure of the risk preference of the individual is through the **certainty equivalent**. It is the value of guaranteed [[Monetary prizes|monetary prize]] that the DM is indifferent on, compared to the lottery. Formally, The DMs certainty equivalent for a lottery $p\in \Delta(X)$ is any prize $x\in X$ such that $x\sim p$. This is denoted by $x_c(p)$
#### Determinants of risk preference
- curvature of the $u$ function
- loss aversion
- non-linear [[probability weighting]]
### Types of risk preference
Assumption: DM is an expected utility maximizer with bernoulli utility function $u:X\to \mathbb{R}$

- if the $u(\mathbb{E}(p)) > V(p)$, the agent is risk averse. The sure value (expected value of the lottery) is taken over the entire lottery, implying that the DM does not want to take on the risk of the lottery. This also means that for the same level of expected utility, $\text{CE}(p)<\mathbb{E}(p)$ (When the DM is indifferent between the CE and the lottery, the CE is lower than the expected value). In terms of utility functions, the DM is risk averse iff $u$ is concave

- If the $u(\mathbb{E}(p)) < V(p)$, the agent is risk loving. For the same level of expected utility, $\text{CE}(p) > \mathbb{E}(p)$ (When the DM is indifferent between the CE and the lottery, the CE is higher the expected value). In terms of utility functions, the DM is risk loving iff $u$ is concave

- If the $u(\mathbb{E}(p)) = V(p)$, the agent is risk neutral. For the same level of expected utility, $\text{CE}(p) = \mathbb{E}(p)$ (When the DM is indifferent between the CE and the lottery, the CE is equal to the expected value). In terms of utility functions, the DM is risk neutral iff $u$ is linear

### Comparing risk preferences
Consider two [[vNm Expected utility]] maximizers, DM1 and DM2.

Let DM1 and DM2 have the same initial wealth. We say that DM1 is at least as risk averse as DM2 if for any lottery $p$ and sure amount $x$, if DM1 prefers $p$ to $x$, then so does DM2
