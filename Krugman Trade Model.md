Assumptions
- Consumer utility is increasing in the number of varieties available to them
- Increasing returns to scale of production function - average cost of production is decreasing in quantity produced
- Monopolistic competition

With these assumptions, two identical countries will trade with each other to minimize average costs. Different varieties of the same good can be produced at scale in different countries (Specialized production). Trade can be used to increase the varieties available to the consumer. This minimizes the average cost for the producer while providing varieties to the consumer. 

For each particular variety of a good, one firm produces it - therefore competition for that good is monopolistic in nature. Therefore firms have some pricing power when it comes to their goods.  However, since there are varieties, there is competition to an extent, and thus firms do not have complete pricing power (beyond a certain price, demand will become 0).

#### Demand Function
Each firm ahs a demand for $Q$ items of a particular variety of a particular good. The total market demand for the good (including all varieties) is given by $S$. The demand function is given by $$Q=S[\frac 1n-b(P-\bar P)]$$where:
- $n$ is the number of firms
- $b$ is an arbitrary parameter that describes the sensitivity of prices to demand
- $P$ is the price that the firm charges
- $\bar P$ is the average price of all other firms producing the same good

The firm chooses a demand level ($P,Q$) with $n, b, \bar P, S$ given to them. Only $S$ and $b$ are exogenous variables however


#### Equilibrium conditions
1. Marginal revenue is equal to the marginal cost of production. This is because there is monopolistic competition
2. Firms make no profits. The revenue of production is equal to the costs
3. Symmetric Equilibrium $$S=nQ, P=\bar P$$This is because all firms have the same cost function ($\text{Cost} = cQ+F$) and the same demand function, consumer preferences, implying that all firms make identical decisions on price and quantity of production

#### Equilibrium price
The total revenue of a firm is given by $$\text{TR}(Q)=P(Q)\cdot Q\tag{1}$$Using the demand function, $$Q=S[\frac 1n-b(P-\bar P)] = (\frac Sn+S b\bar P)-(S b)P$$taking $A = \frac Sn+S b\bar P$ and $B = Sb$,$$Q = A-BP$$$$P=\frac 1B[A-Q]$$Substituting this into (1),$$\text{TR}(Q) = \frac 1B[A-Q]Q = \frac 1B[AQ-Q^2]$$Finding the marginal revenue, $$\text{MR}(Q) = \frac 1B[A-2Q] = \frac 1B[A-Q]-\frac QB$$Therefore, $$\text{MR}(Q) = P-\frac QB\tag 2$$From the first first equilibrium condition, we know that $\text{MR}(Q) = c$. Substituting this into (2),$$P=c+\frac QB\tag 3$$From the third equilibrium condition, we know that $S=nQ$. Substituting this into (3)$$P=c+\frac{S/n}B$$but we know that $B = Sb$. Therefore, $$P = c+\frac1{nb}\tag 4$$Therefore, the firm charges a markup over the marginal cost of production $c$. The larger the number of firms making the same product (larger $n$), the smaller the markup.

#### Equilibrium average cost
The cost function for the firm is given by $$\text{TC}(Q) = F+cQ$$The average cost is therefore given by $$\text{AC}(Q) = \frac{\text{TC}(Q)}{Q}=\frac FQ+c\tag 5$$From equilibrium condition 3, we know that $S=nQ$. Substituting into (5)$$\text{AC}(Q) = c+\frac{nF}{S}\tag 6$$This shows that the larger the number of firms, the more the average cost of production. This is because each firm sells less when there is more competition. 

#### Finding $n$
From the 2nd equilibrium condition, $$\text{TR}(Q) = \text{TC}(Q)$$as profits are zero. Dividing both sides by $Q$, we get the averages. Therefore$$\text{AR}(Q) = \text{AC}(Q)\tag 7$$We know that $$\text{AR}(Q) = \frac{\text{TR}(Q)}Q = P$$substituting this result into (7), we get$$P = \text{AC}(Q)$$Substituting (4) and (6) into this result, $$c+\frac 1{nb}= c+\frac {nF}S$$
$$\frac 1{nb}=\frac{nF}S$$here, everything except $n$ is exogenous. Therefore, $$n^2 = \frac S{bF}$$$$n = \sqrt{\frac{S}{bF}}\tag 8$$
#### Finding the equilibrium optimal price
Putting the value for $n$ into (4),$$P=c+\frac{1}{b\sqrt{\frac{S}{bF}}}=c+\frac 1{\sqrt{\frac{Sb^2}{bF}}}=c+\frac 1{\sqrt{\frac{Sb}{F}}}$$Therefore, $$P = c+\sqrt{\frac{F}{Sb}}\tag 9$$From equilibrium condition 3, we know that the equilibrium is symmetric. Therefore $$\bar P=P = c+\sqrt{\frac{F}{Sb}}$$
### Free trade
Since both the countries are similar, size of the market in the foreign country is given by $S$. Therefore the total size of the market with free trade is given by $S+S=2S$. Using (8), the new number of firms will be $$n = \sqrt{\frac{2S}{bF}}$$$n$ increases by a factor of $\sqrt 2$ when $S$ increases by a factor of 2. This shows that in the new equilibrium, the quantity of goods sold will be higher as $n$ increases less than $S$.  $$Q=\frac{S}{n}$$Using this new value of the size of the market in (9), $$P =c+\sqrt{\frac{F}{2Sb}}$$thus the price falls in the free trade equilibrium. The markup has become smaller. Therefore it intuitively makes sense that the number of goods sold in equilibrium increases in order for firms to break even ( more competition => lower markup). This is in line with the demand function relationship.
