# Reproductive ratio
This is a measure of the spreadability of a disease that is used in [[Disease Epidemiology]]. The reproductive ratio (R) is the average number of people a sick person will infect.

The outcomes of different R values:
	-   If R>1= epidemic, infections increase
	-   If R=1=endemic, constant   
	-   If R<1=contained, infections reduce
