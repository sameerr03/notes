The keynesian cross shows how Y is determined from fixed levels of planned Investment, government spending and taxes.

## Planned expenditure curve
Actual expenditure (Y):: amount spent on goods and services by economic actors.
The economy is assumed to be [[Expenditure method of GDP counting|closed]] here. 
<!--SR:!2022-11-15,20,290-->
Planned expenditure (PE):: amount economic actors would like to spend on goods and services (demand).
<!--SR:!2022-11-09,14,270-->

$$PE=C+G+I$$
Consumption will be a function of the total [[Disposable income]]. Therefore,
$$=f(DI)+G+I$$
The Disposable income can be replaced with income - tax. The tax is independent of Gross income
$$=f(Y-TX)+G+I$$
the function can be replaced with a standard [[consumption function]]. Fixing values of investment, tax and Government Spending, we get the equation
$$PE=C_0+C_1(Y-\bar{TX})+\bar{G}+\bar{I}$$This can be plotted as

## Actual expenditure curve
Actual expenditure is satisfied when income= planned expenditure.

Therefore PE=Y, resulting in a 45 degree line

## Keynesian Cross 
Overlapping the Planned and Actual expenditure curves, we get the keynesian cross

When PE=AE, the economy is in equilibrium, and looks to return to this point.

Y* is the equilibrium income. When actual income is greater than planned expenditure, the demand is low. Firms prefer to cut down on production than stock upon inventory (due to expiry of goods) and so the economy goes back to Y*. If AE< PE, demand is higher, resulting in firms increasing production to keep up, returning the economy to Y*.

At the equillibrium, PE=Y*. Therefore,
$$Y^*
=\frac{C_0+\bar{I}+\bar{G}-c\bar{TX}}{S_1}$$

Equilibrium output is dependant on investment, exogenous consumption, government spending, tax amounts and [[Savings function|MPS]].
