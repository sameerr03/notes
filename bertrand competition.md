There are 2 firms, A and B. Their function is given by $p=a-bq$.
The firms can choose how much to produce. Their action spaces are $(P_A,P_B):([0,\infty),[0,\infty))$
The outcomes is the cartesian product of $P_A$ and $P_B$. 
Rules of the game:
- if $p_A<p_B$ -> A will supply everything as A is cheaper than B for the same good. Therefore, $\Pi_A(P_A,P_B)=(p-c)q$. The profit of A is the price-marginal cost of each good into the amount of good.
- if $p_A>p_B$ -> B will supply everything as B is cheaper than A for the same good. Therefore, $\Pi_A(P_A,P_B)=0$. A will have no demand.
- if $p_a=p_b$ -> there is equal demand for both. As a result, $\Pi_A(P_A,P_B)=\frac{1}{2}(p-c)q$
 
 Using best responses,
  $B_A(p_B)=p_B-\epsilon$ if $p_B>c$
			  $\ge p_B$ if $p_B<c$
			  = c if $p_B=c$
  $B_B(p_A)=p_A-\epsilon$ if $p_A>c$
			  $\ge p_A$ if $p_B<c$
			  = c if $p_A=c$

Supposing both firms consider price $x$. Firm A can gain the entire demand for the good by pricing their good at $x-\epsilon$ at the expense of B. Therefore, in A's stratergy set, $x-\epsilon$ **weakly dominates** $x$ and so $x$ will never be a part of A's stratergy set. Iterating and removing strategies for both players, Both firms eventually reach the price $p=c$. below c, the firm does not make  
profit and will not choose to exist. Therefore both firms will end up pricing their good at c, making no profit. $P_A=P_B=c$. This replicates perfect competition.
