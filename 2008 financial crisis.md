# 2008 financial crisis
## Causes and Effects
- Dot com crash in the early 2000s
- US shifted to low interest rates (expansionary [[Monetary policy]]) due to recessionary pressure from startups built on loans (dot com bubble)
- Low interest rates led to the increase in demand for home loans, leading to the emergence of 'sub-prime' borrowers. 
- [[bank]]s use securities (promises of an income stream in the future) of return from the loans to profit by giving them as principal to MNCs/financial companies for investing in exchange for returns on investment.
- Prices of houses were rising as demands increased -> increased number of sub-prime borrowers. When borrowers defaulted on their loans, ownership of the house goes to the bank which then sells the house. With the increase in defaults by sub prime borrowers, the supply of homes increased, leading to a fall in prices. With this fall in housing prices, fearing loss of assets, households reduce [[consumption function|consumption]]$^2$. 
- An increase in defaulting also resulted in the faltering of the securities market as no future income stream, MNCs could not invest anymore, reducing $I^3$. 
- This created a distrust in the market, leading to a crash in the stock market, further decreasing $I^4$.

[[liquidity trap]] forms. Crisis spreads globally, leading to an international crisis.

## Escape from the crisis
- Treasury made it, public knowledge that there was increased amounts of money, creating [[great depression#Deflation and investment|expectations of inflation]], increasing [[investment]]. The money was used to create bail out packages, keeping bankrupt firms that could revive the economy going. The bailouts were selective, creating better market practices, increasing money supply in the right hands leading to outward shifts of [[LM curve|LM]] and [[IS curve]]s.
- Govt. promised medical insurance, allowing for consumers to spend today rather than save, increasing C, shifting IS outward.
