**GDP**:: The market value of the output of all **the final goods and services** in an economy in a given period.
<!--SR:!2022-11-06,6,210-->
The outputs of intermediate goods that are inputs to final production are excluded form the GDP to prevent double counting. Non market products - llegal transactions,
products from other years (buildings - are not included unless in the year of completion) are also not included in the GDP.

Goods and services produced by the government is also included. The value of these services are accounted for using their cost as these services and goods are not sold in a market. Government transfers are not included

GDP can also be expressed *per-capita*, which is the total GDP divided by the population. It is the average income of the people of a country. Per capita growth rate is given by Growth rate of GDP - growth rate of population. 

## Ways of Measuring GDP
Three equivelant ways
- [[Expenditure method of GDP counting| Expenditure method]]:: Total expenditure made by various entities in the economy (households, firms, govt, and other countries on home economy products)
<!--SR:!2022-11-16,21,270-->
- Value Added Method: Y= output sold - raw materials and intermediate goods. Sum up value added for every product in the economy to get the GDP.
- Income method: Sum of all incomes

## Nominal GDP
Nominal GDP is the GDP that is evaluated at present market prices

## Real GDP
Real GDP accounts for [[inflation]] by using constant prices. The prices of goods and taxes from the base year are compared to the prices of goods and tax rates from the base year to evaluate real GDP.

## GDP Deflator
$$ \frac {{ Nominal GDP}\ } { {Real GDP}\ } \times 100$$
