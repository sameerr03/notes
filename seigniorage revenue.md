In the [[Inflation model]], the monetary authority arbitrarily printed more money in each time period of the [[Overlapping generation model]]. This model justifies the printing of this additional money by using it to finance government spending (Seigniorage revenue).

**In time period $t$,**
$$\text{Seigniorage revenue}=v_t(M_t-M_{t-1})$$$$=(1-\frac{M_{t-1}}{M_t})v_tM_t$$$$=(1-\frac 1z)v_tM_t$$Where:
- $v_tM_t$ is the real value of the monetary base. The monetary base is the total stock of nominal money in the economy ($M_t$)
- $1-1/z$ is the rate of inflation tax. is between 0 and one.

The seigniorage revenue can be written as the rate of inflation tax times the real value of the monetary base

In period $t$,
the young's budget set is$$c_{1,t}+v_tm_t\le y$$When old in $t+1$, the budget set of the now old is$$c_{2,t+1}\le v_{t+1}m_t$$There is no $a$ term as the additional printed money is being used by the government. Putting both the budget sets together to find the LTBC, we get $$c_{1,t}+\frac{v_t}{v_{t+1}}c_{2,t+1}\le y$$From the market clearing condition, we know that $v_t/v_{t+1}=z/n$. Therefore at the SME, the LTBC is$$c_1+\frac zn c_2 \le y$$
#### Welfare comparison
Comparing the budget set and the feasibility set of the [[centralized solution with government spending]],

From the plot of the feasibility set and the budget set, it is clear that there is a welfare loss when it comes to printing money, even when government expenditure is accounted for. 

#### Ideal inflation for maximizing seigniorage rev.
![[Pasted image 20230915193622.png|600]]
The seigniorage revenue is given by the formula
$$\text{SR}=(1-\frac 1z)N_t(y-c_1)$$As $z$ increases the "inflation tax" increases. A larger portion of the money demand is taken as seigniorage. However, from the [[seigniorage revenue#Welfare comparison]], we can see that people tend to overconsume in period 1 and underconsume in period 2 due to a larger penalty in holding money across time periods. This means that $c_1$ increases. Beyond a certain point, the increase in $c_1$ leads to a fall in the revenue from the maxima, despite and increase in $z$. This leads to the graph as seen above.
