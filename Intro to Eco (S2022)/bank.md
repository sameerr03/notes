# Banks
A **Bank** is a [[firm]] that makes profit through [[borrowing]] and [[lending]] activities. The interests that banks offer in deposits is less than the amount that they offer on loans, which allows them to make profits.

**Central Banks** are the only banks that can create base money (leagally has to be accepted). These banks are typically a part of the government. Commercial banks hold accounts at these banks where they hold base money. These accounts are called commercial bank reserves. 

Bank loans are a method that "create money". By increasing their liability (money payable at any moment to the borrower) and assets (money owed by borrower) their net worth remains the same (before interest is added). the [[Intro to Eco (S2022)/balance sheet]] is equal on both sides. 

When interest is collected, liablity to the borrower is reduced, increasing the net worth, allowing for profits. 

By taking and making loans, banks provide the economy with the service of maturity transformation (borrowing short term and lending long term(called liquidity transformation because deposits are liquid and loans are illiquid). 

Banks often lend more than they hold in legal tender. This results in a potential risk if all customers try to withdraw money at once. Banks can borrow money from the [[Intro to Eco (S2022)/money market]] in order to prevent this.

## Profitability
The profitability of banking as a business is based on
- operational costs: salaries, renting
- Interest costs: costs of borrowing from the money market
- Revenue: Interest and repayment of loans given to customers. 
- Default rate on loans given

The profitablility is dependant on the difference between the cost of borrowing and the return to lending, taking acount of the default rate and operational costs. 

Bank borrowing (deposits and money market borrowing) is on the liabilities side of the balance sheets, lending is on the assets side.

Assets:
- Base money (cash and central bank reserves)
- FInancial assets such as stocks and gov. bonds
- Loans given to other banks
- Loans to households and firms
- Bank assets such as buildings and equipments

Liabilities:
- Deposits
- Loans from the money market

The net worth of the bank is its equity (shares issued by the bank and the accumulated profits that have not been paid as dividends to shareholders). 

The leverage ratio is the value of assets divided by the equity
