# Classical theory of economics

firms want to maximize profit ($\pi$)
$$\pi=pf(\bar{K},L) - wL - r\bar{K}$$
for max profit, slope of profit labour function at that point should be 0
$$\frac{\delta \pi}{\delta L}=pf_{L}(\bar{K},L) - w=0$$ 
$$p=\frac{w}{MPL}$$
$$MPL=\frac{w}{p}$$
=> MPL = [[real wage]]

Classical economists belive that this is an [[Intro to Eco (S2022)/equillibrium]] that is maintained forever. As a result they advocated for no government intervention.

At this equillibrium value, labour remaines the same when prices changes. If prices are increased, wages rise to match, re-establishing the equillibrium.

## Growth under classical economics
Population growth -> Increase in labour -> Increase in production leading to growth

## Criticisms of classical economics 
- Self correcting measures that the economists belived in were inneffective during the 1929 great depression
- Classical economists looked only at long run measures and GDP growth rates
