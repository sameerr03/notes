# Consumption Function
Plots income to consumption

**Consumption ($C$)** has two parts
- **Autonomous consumption($C_0$)**: Fixed amount one will spend, independant of current [[income]]. Expectations of future income are reflected in autonomous consumption
- Consumption dependant on income

The slope of the consumption function is the **marginal propensity to consume($C_1$)**. MPC<1 as households are not going to exhaust their entire income on consumption unless necessary. MPC varies across people - poor households will have higher MPC than a rich household.

The consumption function is:
$$C=C_0+C_1Y$$



Average propensity to consume (APC) = $$ C(Y) /Y$$
