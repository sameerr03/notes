The efficient market hypothesis says that the markets value any asset based on the information that they possess. Any information that is released is incorporated into the asset prices. In the case of markets being efficient and decisions in the markets being taken by rational actors immediately after receiving information, markets prices would revolve around the actual value of assets. However, markets need not necessarily be true as with the case after the 2008 housing crisis, where the housing market was grossly overvalued because the information about sub-prime borrowers was either not known or was not acted upon. 

Forms of market efficiency
- Weak: Information about past prices cant help you forecast prices.
- Semi-strong: All publicly available information is already accounted for into the stock prices
- Strong Form: insider information is accounted for the prices of assets
Efficient markets theory is not completely true as all decisions made are not rational, even when the decisions that are made are on all the available information.
