A relation is a collection of ordered pairs, where each pair contains one object from each [[Set theory|set]]

For the [[Set theory#Cartesian product of sets|cartesian product]] of the two sets $A$ and $B$, the relation $R$ exists such that $$R\subseteq A\times B$$
#### Types of relations
- Reflexive: $$aRa\ \forall\ a\in A $$This evaluates if this relation holds with a set to itself. For the relation "is parallel to", A line $l$ is parallel to itself, and thus the relation is reflexive
- Symmetric:$$aRb\implies bRa$$if the line $l$ is parallel to $m$, then $m$ is parallel to $l$. This is a symmetric relation
- Transitive:$$aRb, bRc \implies aRc$$If $l$ is parallel to $m$ and $m$ is parallel to $n$, then $l$ is parallel to $n$. This is a transitive relation
- Anti-symmetric:$$aRb, bRa \implies a=b$$If $l$ is parallel to $m$ and $m$ is parallel to $l$ this does not mean that $l=m$. Therefore this is not an anti-symmetric relation
- Equivalence: A relation that is symmetric, transitive and reflexive. "is parallel to" is such a relation
- Order: A relation that is transitive, reflexive and anti symmetric. a subset is such a relation
