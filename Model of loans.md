Consider a two time period world ($t=1,2$). The agents in the world live for these two periods. There are two type of agents 
- **L-type** receive a non-zero endowment in $t=1$ and nothing in $t=2$
- **B-Type** receive a non-zero endowment in $t=2$ and nothing in $t=1$

Preferences are such that all agents prefer to consume non zero amount of goods in both periods of their lives. Do not want no consumption in either period. To solve this, L-types lend to B-types in $t=1$, and B-types repay this using endowments in $t=2$. 

##### Loan supply
the budget set for **L-types** will be$$c_{1L}+l=y$$
Where $l$ is the loan given out at an individual level$$c_{2L}=rl$$where $r$ is the **gross rate of interest** (1+actual interest rate). Finding the LTBC,$$c_{1L}+\frac 1rc_{2L}=y$$![[Pasted image 20230923195235.png|400]]
With an increase in $r$, the budget set for the L-types get steeper. The optimal points of consumption change with $c_{1L}^*$ dropping, resulting in $l^*$ increasing. Extrapolating the relation,

##### Loan Demand 
The budget set for B-type agents is given by$$c_{1B}=b$$where $b$ is the amount borrowed. $$c_{2B}=y-rb$$The LTBC is$$rC_{1B}+C_{2B}=y$$Plotting this budget set,

As $r$ increases, $y/r$ becomes smaller, slope becomes steeper and $c_{1B}*$ falls (only substitution effect). This results in a fall in the loan demand. Aggregating this trend,
