$z_{\alpha/2}$ is chosen such that $1-PMF(z_{\alpha/2})=\frac{\alpha}{2}$, then the probability of Z taking a value between $-z_{\alpha/2}$ and $z_{\alpha/2}$ is $1-\alpha$. This is the blue region in the graph and is known as the **confidence interval**.


When $\mu$ isunknown, we can specify the region based on confidence in which $\mu$ is most likely to occur. Essentially a tradeoff between precision and error. 3 convential ranges:
- 90% confidence = $\alpha/2=0.05$
- 95% confidence = $\alpha/2=0.025$
- 99% confidence = $\alpha/2=0.005$

$$1-\alpha = P\{\bar{X}-z_{\alpha/2}\cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\le\mu\le\bar{X}+z_{\alpha/2}\cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\}$$
