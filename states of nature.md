**States of nature** or contingencies are taken as primitive. Each state gives a complete description of how all uncertainty resolves itself - an exhaustive list of all scenarios that might unfold. These states should be both Mutually exclusive (at most one state occurs) and exhaustive (At least one state occurs). 

The set of states is given by $S$. The set of outcomes/prices $X$, is the set of all prizes regarding bets made upon the state nature $S$. A third set of acts, is a set of functions that map $f:S\to X$, defined for all $S$.
