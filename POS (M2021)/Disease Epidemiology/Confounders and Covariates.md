# Confounders and Covariates
-   Covariates are characteristics of the participants in an experiment. They affect risk
-   Confounding: Effects of the exposure on an outcome are mixed in with the effects of an additional factor (or factors) distorting the true relationship
-   Condition for confounding to occur
	-   Confounding factor must be associated with both risk factor and outcome
	-   Distributed unequally between groups being compared
	-   Cannot be an intermediary step in the causal pathway from exposure to outcome
-   Eg - Association between obesity and heart disease can be confounded by age, diet, smoking, and other factors
