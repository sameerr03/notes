The attention filter is a type of [[Consideration set]]. It is restricted by the fact that the DMs consideration set does not change when an alternative that the DM is not considering is removed. 

Consideration set mapping $\Gamma:\chi\to\chi$ is an attention filter if for any $S$, $$\Gamma(S)=\Gamma(S-x)\text{ whenever } x\not\in\Gamma(S)$$
