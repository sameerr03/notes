# Monetary Policy
Central Banks activities to stabilize the economy

Central [[bank]]s set an inflation target. Policy interest rate is determined in part by the inflation target. In order to set the policy rate, 
1. Desired [[aggregate demand]] level is chosen based on labour market [[Intro to Eco (S2022)/equillibrium]] and the [[Phillips curve]].
2. Estimating real interest rate that will produce this level of AD. ([[multiplier effect]])
3. Calcultate the nominal policy rate that will produce this interest rate

## Effects of policy making
Policymaking can imbue confidence in the central bank, leading to higher investment and profit expectations

Assets can increase in prices based on the market interest rate set by the Central bank. 

Interest rates affect the demand for home currency in the foreign exchange market, affects the exchange rate. Exchange rate also effects demand for home-produced goods, affects net exports. (therefore affects AD)

## Stabilizing the economy 
The central bank stimulates investment by lowering the real intrest rate. Shifts AD curve upward.
