The present value of a growing asset can be used in order to determine whether to invest or not. A purchase of an asset that is underpriced according to the present value is a good investment, even if the growth rate is declining. Suppose the asset of value $X$ is growing with a constant rate $1+g$. In each period, the value of the asset becomes
$X$ in period 1
$X(1+g)$ in period 2
$X(1+g)^2$ in period 3 and so on, infinitely

The present value of the asset is given by $$PV=\frac{X}{r-g}$$Where:
- $r$ is the [[Intertemporal consumption|discount rate]]
If there is risk in the asset, the discount rate will be higher. This is because the future of the asset will be given less value as it is more risky.
