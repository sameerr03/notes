The net working capital of a corporation is defined as$$\text{Net Working Capital}=\text{Current Assets}-\text{Current Liabilities}$$
where current assets and current liabilities are derived from the [[Balance sheet]]. It describes how much of a companies cash has gone into short term assets vs liabilities. The **change in net working capital** describes how a companies cash has flown compared to the previous year. An increase in NWC implies that cash has left the business to purchase the additional assets/get rid of the liabilities pr both.

| Balance sheet item | 2018 | 2019 |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Current assets | 707 | 761 |
| (Current liabilities) | (455) | (490) |
| **Net Working Capital** | **252** | **271** |

The change in NWC is therefore 271-252=19. This is the amount of cash that has exited the business to change its current assets/liabilities balance.
