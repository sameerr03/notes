Model that describes low level of population growth seen before the industrial revolution. The model is founded on a few key assumptions
- When incomes([[Gross Domestic Product|GDP per capita]]) increse, there is an increase in the growth rate of population. 
- An increase in population leads to a decrease in GDP per capita as the same resources are used by more people.

These assumptions determine a steady state that all economies would lie in, where there is no long-run increase in income even with technological progress. 

The first assumption leads to the graph,

The second assumption leads to the graph,

These two graphs together predict that $y$ remains at the steady state, $y_{ss}$. Irrespective of technological advancements.

#### Reaching the steady state
If the GDP per capita is above $y_{ss}$, the population growth rate is above 0. This  results in the population growing, leading to an increase in L. As L begins to increase with the growth rate, $y$ starts to fall, going back to $y_{ss}$ with diminishing returns.

#### Improvement in technology
With an increase in technology, the L-y graph moves upward, resulting in higher GDP per capita with the same level of population.

The increase in GDP leads to an increase in pop. growth rate, leading to an increase in population, decreasing y, leading to GDP level stagnating at the same level of population. 

### Escapting the malthusian trap
The malthusian trap was escaped by a downward shift of the $\frac {\dot L}{L}-y$ graph. This was achieved by a reduction of fertility rates, death and birth rates.

Death rates fall due to technology. Once people realise this, birth rates start to fall (lag b/w birth and death rates). Increase in the need for education due to industrialisation leads to the tradeoff between spending more on one child and having more children leaning towards having less children -> lowering fertility rates.
