In an [[Expenditure method of GDP counting|open]] economy, foreign money and foreign assets can be held along with domestic assets and money. The return on holding foreign and domestic assets is described as follows

|time|Domestic(Currency -> D)|Foreign (Currency -> F)|
|---|---|---|
|$t$|1D->buy asset |1D->FE$_t$-> buy asset|
|$t+1$|asset -> $(1+r_d)$D|asset -> $(1+r_f)$FE$_{t+1}^e$|

Where E is the [[Exchange rates|Exchange rate]] between D and F, E$_{t+1}^e$ is the expected exchange rate in time t+1, and r is the respective return rates on the investments. The return from the foreign investment is $$\frac{E_t(1+r_t)}{E_{t+1}^e}D$$
When both investments are held by a domestic agent, they both must offer the same rate of return  (ignoring conversion fees)
$$1+r_d=\frac{E_t(1+r_t)}{E_{t+1}^e}$$
After rearranging and taking logs,
$$r_d=r_f-(\frac{E_{t+1}^e-E_t}{E_t})$$
### Conclusions
Rise in exchange rates in t+1 :: $r_d$ reduces
Fall in exchange rates in t+1 :: $r_d$ increases
