The price to earnings ratio of a company is its price per share divided by its earnings per share. The price-earnings ratio can tell us about whether a company is a good investment. From the [[Dividend Discount Model]] we can find the price to earnings ratio as$$\frac{P_0}{E_1^e}$$The price of the stock is given by $$\text{Price} = \text{No growth value per share}+\text{PVGO}$$where PVGO is the **[[Future and present values|present value]] of growth opportunities**. From the [[Present Value of a stock]], we know that $$P=\frac{Div_1}{r-g}$$Since we know that the dividend is all EPS that is not retained, if $b$ is the [[Forecasting financial statements|plowback ratio]], then$$P=\frac{(1-b)EPS}{r-g}$$Therefore$$\frac{P}{EPS}=\frac{1-b}{r-g}=\frac{1-b}{r-b\times ROE}$$If $b=0$, $$\frac{P}{EPS}=\frac 1r$$If $ROE=r$, $$\frac{P}{EPS}=\frac{1-b}{r-rb}=\frac 1r$$If $b>0$, $ROE>r$ then the P/E ratio is greater than $1/r$. 
 
#### Finding the PVGO

The PVGO can be found out by taking the difference between the no growth and growth stock prices under the dividend discount model. The no growth price is given by $$P_{NG}=\frac{EPS_1}{r}$$As we know that when the plowback ratio is 0 (EPS is paid out to investors entirely), there is no growth ([[Dividend Discount Model#Finding dividend growth rates]]). With growth, $$P_G=\frac{Div_1}{r-g}$$Therefore, we get the present value of growth opportunities as $$PVGO=P_G-P_{NG}$$

### PEG ratio
This accounts for the growth issue in price to earnings ratio of a company. This is given by $$\text{PEG} = \frac{P/E}{g}$$Investment decisions can be based on 
- PEG = 1 => correct price
- PEG < 1 => underpriced
- PEG > 1 => overpriced

In terms of PVGO, $$\text{PEG} = \frac{ \frac 1k(1+\frac{\text{PVGO}}{E_1^e/k})}{g}$$
